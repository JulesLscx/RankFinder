       " 'As every other reviewer said, you can\\'t put this one down and it\\'s 858 pages! Matthews\\' writing as usual is phenomenal. My only complaint is with the sci fi aspect of the story, a child with telekinesis talents which just do NOT exist, and I was surprised given Matthews\\' obvious athiestic views in every one of his books. Plus he uses this as a \"deus ex machina\" to save some of his characters who would otherwise be dead if the child hadn\\'t come to the miraculous rescue with her gift.However this book has LOTS of characters who are colorfully written. Some of them just fade out, not sure why they were there in the first place (many needed chapters given to an artist who paints a nude portrait of a prostitute who wants to be the mistress of the husband of the female sibling in the story.) But this is probably because Matthews is so prolific he just can\\'t stop writing.The story builds up to where there should be a huge climax, but kind of fizzles out. The train chase at the end went on for pages and I skimmed and skipped that. There was an epilogue so we know the fates of all the characters, but also kind of anti-climactical.

The plot centers around James Herriot, a newly qualified veternarian and his employment as assistant veternarian to Siegfried Farnon in the village of Darrowby. You will also meet a cast of colorful characters, Tristian Farnon, Siegfried\\'s younger brother, Helen Alderson, Mrs. Hall, Mrs. Pumphrey and her Pekinese, Tricky-Woo,and a host of other colorful characters who make this a memorable read. James Herriot has also authored several other books, each one stands on its own merit and are a treasure for your family library.

The reason was to escape a heartless blackmailer. However, the planned murder goes awry when a real murderer steps in and disposes of M. Renauld. Poirot's mission is to discover the reason for the blackmail, find the true murderer, and to outwit his competition in the form of M. Giraud of the Paris Surete. Giraud, a young detective, is contemptuous of Poirot's unsophisticated methods but lives to regret his lack of respect for the master detective.Romance blooms for Captain Hastings when he meets and marries his wife as a result of the events in this case.

Well, I made a decision that I would never be able to believe in a God for sure, that I would find out at death.Instead, \"Divine Intervention\" caused me to receive this book from Pato Banton at a Regga Festival. I saw such deep love and truth in him on stage like no other. He was exactly the same way I was striving to become. So after the show I asked him what source he used to gain such spiritual growth. Ie Bible, Rastafarian Bible, etc. He told me about the Urantia Book, explaining that the information it contained was given to us by beings not of this planet. I started to read it as a skeptic of course, 100% skeptical, but gave it a try due to his loving and kind spirit, and the way he desired for all of us at the show to unite and experience love.Anyway, long story short, the book is amazing, I believe it is truthful. All of the areas in the bible I had problems with were expanded on and explained with so much more detail that every single issue I had, begin to be clear to me. It all makes sense, its so true, its unexplainable.Read it for yourself. If your a Christian, Start with the Jesus papers, or \"the life of Jesus\".

It can be read on its own, but there are moments when it was helpful to have read the previous two. \"Perelandra\" is by far the best of the three. I was disappointed there was no closure to the story. Lewis makes mincemeat of our feeble minds. His insights are amazing and his concept of the world beyond is exquisite. The English dialect can be slightly aggravating.The novel is centered around a university now owned and run by a group of intellectuals set out to change the world by the creation of a \"new man\". They created this new world order front to rid the world of undesirables, evoke a revolution upon the earth, and enforce a police state. The \"worldly\" Ransom is back, but not as one of the main characters.

       " '\"The Lord of the Rings\" is usually found in a single volume, or in three volumes: 1) \"The Fellowship of the Ring\", 2) \"The Two Towers\", and 3) \"The Return of the King\". My recommended reading age is 13+ years old, and I recommend reading \"The Hobbit\" first.When I was 15 years old in high school, I had to read \"The Hobbit\" for an English class. After reading that book, the teacher then let us borrow \"The Lord of the Rings\". Before I had started \"The Return of the King\", I had bought my own set of books. After I had read both books, I actually liked \"The Hobbit\" better than \"The Lord of the Rings\" at first - because \"The Hobbit\" was brighter: a fun, grand adventure with more humor, whereas \"The Lord of the Rings\" was darker: a serious, grim life and death struggle for world survival. But by the time I was about 16, the historical significance of \"The Lord of the Rings\" began to appeal more to me. This is especially true if you read Appendices A and B of \"The Lord of the Rings\", and also read \"The Silmarillion\". You begin to understand the rich history of Tolkien\\'s Middle-Earth/ Beleriand creation. How \"The Silmarillion\" brings out the significant events of the First and Second Ages, while the events in \"The Lord of the Rings\" are the culmination of the Third Age...each Age lasting thousands of years and ending with an immensely significant event.It was 25 years before I read \"The Lord of the Rings\" again, but Bilbo, Frodo, Sam, Gandalf, Aragorn, Galadriel, Legolas, Gimli, and many more had become household names! I had matured over those years, and my tastes changed. I was no longer a big fantasy/science-fiction reader: instead I was reading military history. I didn\\'t expect to still love \"The Lord of the Rings\" the way I did as a teenager. I was happily wrong! This is still an exciting book, but I discovered what I really love...it is allegory-type stories. J. R. R. Tolkien himself has said that \"The Lord of the Rings\" is not allegory, because he hated allegory where he felt the author is dictating to the reader what is in their story...and that any other interpretation is incorrect. Tolkien wanted a reader to apply their own experiences and tastes to influence what they were reading. OK, but in real history one can still get allegory if their own experiences and tastes allow it. How many can learn about World War II and not apply the basic allegorical interpretation that good triumphs over evil? I\\'ve heard of, and can understand, several allegorical interpretations of \"The Lord of the Rings\". Frodo is like Jesus Christ: bearing the greatest of burdens for world salvation while being tempted to stray from his purpose, and the weight of the ring is similar to Christ\\'s cross . The One Ring is like the atomic bomb: the ultimate weapon that corrupts whoever uses it, despite even good intentions, into a power-hungry creature of evil. There\\'s an ecological message with the Ents trying to protect trees; and also the natural beauty of various places throughout Middle-Earth, while evil beings try to destroy it all (including the use of mechanical and polluting progress). I also get out of \"The Lord of the Rings\" a sense of a military mission: that Frodo & Sam are behind enemy lines on a mission that could end a war, and that Frodo realizes that getting back home or even staying alive doesn\\'t matter - just completion of the mission...that\\'s also sacrifice, perseverance, & camaraderie so prevalent in the military history I\\'ve read. There\\'s prejudice with years of animosity between elves and dwarves, and how small, kind gestures can begin to erase all those blighted years...also, how people or races can put aside differences to solve a common problem. There\\'s the recognition of the small, common people (citizen soldiers) that perform the greatest, toughest, and most necessary duty in any war. There\\'s world peace in peril and that something needs to be done before it\\'s too late. There\\'s avoiding the easier way out, and facing one\\'s problems and seeing them through to a conclusion despite severe hardships.I feel that Tolkien saw a little bit of himself in many of the good races of his world. The hobbits are like Tolkien because they love food, company, and talking about family. The ents are like Tolkien because of their unbounded love of trees. Gandalf the wizard is like Tolkien because of his exceptional intelligence and purpose of guiding others along the right path. Some men are like Tolkien because of their inner strength and gallantry, while other men show weakness by succumbing to evil...very realistic. But I believe he saw the beauty and enchantment of the elves in his wife, and why he loved both most dearly: that\\'s why on their gravestone Luthien appears after his wife\\'s name, and Beren appears after his name. The dwarves don\\'t seem to resemble Tolkien, but they are present in much folklore, which is linked to his personal love of medieval languages.\"The Lord of the Rings\" is a masterpiece in my opinion, and it\\'s size (over 1000 pages in any printed format) is pretty daunting, but give it a shot! It\\'ll be time well spent. And get ready for adventure, terror, excitement, love, treachery, devotion, monumental historic events, unforgettable battles, military strategy, exotic languages & culture, etc. See what you get out of the book! I think most people will enjoy it and/or be moved by it. And who knows, maybe it\\'ll become your favorite book too!',\n",

Instead, the poems examinge Barrett Browning's guilt over her brother's death, her awakening passion for Robert Browning, and her fear of an inability to love. If one looks very closely at these poems, what appears is not a tribute to Browning, but in fact a brilliant woman's realization that her life has been totally sterile, and that she has now been placed in the precarious position of having to make choices that will alter the course of her life. Tehcnically, the poems are brilliant; written with all of Barrett Browning's characteristic blend of caution and verve.\",\n",
       " \"Thomas Hardy's Jude the Obscure, is rather compelling, but not a book you can't put down. Where its grip on the reader lacks, its attacks on a repressive social structure dedicated to conforming to religion make the story applicable to any time and place.Jude, the main character, begins his life as a lower class boy with aspirations to become a great scholar in the illustrious universities of Christminster. Jude puts his heart and soul into a dream he believes attainable, but society and his vices derail him. Hardy shows even an honorable high hoping young man cannot reach the heights of society unless he conforms to its traditions and obligations.Marriage is the example that demonstrates the main characters obligations to society. Jude can't pursue an academic career because of his requirement to please society by marrying Arabella. Jude and Sue are unable to pursue their truest desires because society thwarts them due to their unconventional relationship. The story seems to attack marriage, as none who impart in it are happy, but Hardy is really trying to say that it is society's regard and adherence to tradition that only allows for a mainstream view of life. Society would rather have a man and woman living miserably under marriage vows than living happily but unconventionally in a stable but unmarried family. It is society's harsh judgment that ruins people; not marriage.The book starts off with some sensual action and then moves a bit more slowly as it delves into the interplay between characters that exemplifies the books theme. The pace finally picks up again as the events at the end of the book become more feverish and intense.Overall, the book compresses the reader as he feels the graveness of society's judgment upon unconventionality. It is also intriguing to see the characters fight for what they believe is right despite society's heavy hand upon them.\",\n",
       " \"This book is one of the 1920s most popular, and shows how life was back then. Before the depression, people had fun and would dance carelessly in the night to big bands and fox trot.

       " \"Very exciting story, well told. I won't be spoiling anything by telling you how the story begins. It begins with a great hook, and it will hook you.Michael Baisden's altar ego Julian Payne is a talk show host doing a show called Love Lust and Lies. Hmm, sounds familiar. Michael is a very popular talk show host right now in New York City, doing a show called Love Lust and Lies, very similar to Julian's. In fact I was surprised to learn that Michael started out as an author, not a talk show host. Michael IS Julian, except that I hope he was never shot by a stalker. Real person, made-up story. I hope.The book opens with Michael being shot by a female stalker named Olivia Brown. He's being rushed to a hospital, his life in the balance. He's conscious, on a stretcher, and he is asking the emergency medical people if his daughter and his girlfriend are all right. He's not getting any answers from them. Nor is he getting any reassurance from them that he will live.Well, we've all heard that the best way to begin a book is to start with something dramatic. It works here.We are then taken on a long flashback that lasts until the book is nearly over, since the opening scene isn't completed for us until the end of the book. The entire book is taking us through the events leading to the attack.These are some of the characters you will meet in this story. Julian's ten year old daughter Samantha (who is exposed to Olivia Brown as well), his girlfriend Terri (also at risk), his loyal co-worker Mitch, his best bud Eddie the womanizer, and of course the villain of the piece, pretty Olivia. She's pretty for sure, pretty crazy.This is a self published book. I like the new cover, Olivia seen from behind with a gun in her left hand. The book that I have is an older version with a different cover. I wonder if the new version was edited. The one I have really could have used some editing, for misspelled words, left-out words, secretarial stuff. It's not a question of urban language, it's a question of flat out mistakes in a lot of places. It doesn't detract from the story. Who really cares after all. But if I was doing a self published book I'd fix all that.I agree with one of the reviewers on this site who said that Michael is one hell of a self promoter, talking about his previous book The Maintenance Man several times in this book. I guess you don't get where Michael is by hiding your light under a lampshade. Hey world - here I am, pay attention! Check out my other book while you're at it!I like Michael Baisden. He does a good radio show. Too bad I can't listen to it at work anymore. I like the way he teases the women in the radio audience and builds up the men, when he has his War of the Sexes call-in quiz shows.\",\n",

They have very complicated recipes that taste terrible, with the exception of the desserts.La Dolce Vegan is the kind of food I like: simple, easy, but very tasty. It is worth the price of the book for the Vegan Cheeseburger Pizza recipe alone. If you like the tastes on a burger, you will love this one. I've made it several times, once for a friend who was visiting from out of town, who flipped for it. The mushroom soup is also really, really good. Another recipe I can't stop making is the peanut butter coconut cereal bars with chocolate topping. I am addicted to these and have brought them into my office a few times. Co-workers have asked for the recipe and get excited when they see me arrive with them.The recipes are also economical. The ingredients you have to buy for the pizza will make three pizzas, the ingredients for the cereal bars will make a couple of batches(with tons of cereal left over).As with any cookbook, there are a few duds.

I found the book to be very intresting in both area's. Anne Rice has a fabulus talent with bringing a character to life on the page while at the same time painting a realistic canvas for that character to live around. I found that the many thought provoking ideas about God vs. Devil, Good vs. Evil, right vs. Wronge were all captured beautifully and let me look at these ideas of life in a completly and sometimes desturbing way. But by fare the biggest grabe that the book gives to the reader is its facinating characters: from the charming and villanis Lestat to the contimplative and regretful Louis and the woman within the child that we come to know as Claudia. The relationships that each character shares with the others is also fasinating. Mostly shown in a sexual way, Louis and Lestat both are attracted to Claudia and it is left up to the reader to truely discover how fare they all went with those feelings and the relationships between Lestat and Louis or Armond and Louis.

Reality and simulation melt together seamlessly, without a trace of resistence from the archtypal family whose path we follow as they prepare themselves for a Las Vegas vacation to witness the much hyped Media Event of Bear v. Shark. Bachelder keeps a straight face through out most of this short but punchy novel, and displays an ear for the way television cant infiltrates our daily speech, and invades our dream life. Scattered through out the book are a heap of fast and savage rips on Mass Mediated news, sports call-in shows, flouncy entertainment underwhich nothing substantial resides.In this world, experts in the guise of pundits, jocks, philosophers, and academics all feed aan uncountably intrusive technology that renders every distraction and disturbance into an entertainment value, to be used until a new contrived sequence of illusion can be set in place.Bachelder, demonstrating a brevity and incisive wit that trashes the claims made for the word-gorged \"genius\" of D.F. Wallace, writes surely, sharply, with his eye never off his target.Though he does, at times, resort to the sort of post-modernism stylistics and cliches, such as having the author step out from the story to deliver some self-aware discourse on the limits of narrative\\'s capacity to represent the external world fully, completely -- he has a novel or two to go before the lit.critese is pounded out of him -- our author finally reveals a humane side underneath the smart language, and issues forth a funny yet serious warning about our habit of relinquishing our thinking and our capacity to live imagitively over to the hands of data-drunk programmers.A terrific first effort.',\n",

I truely wish more had been written about Leah's daughter Dinah. The Biblical records were indeed sketchy at best. Here Diamant can only guess what happened.

News, Mon, 15 Nov 2004 4:13 PM PST\\'SCRAPBOOK\\' DELIVERS THE GOODS (Headline)By Robert Osborne NEW YORKLiza Minnelli has certainly had her share of publicized woes of late, but something\\'s on the horizon that should cheer her considerably.Scott Schechter has compiled a magnificent book on the one aspect of L. M. that always seems to get short shrift or is altogether ignored these days, i. e.,her years of delivering the goods in front of cameras and on stages throughout the world. That work has won her, to date, an Oscar (1972), three Tonys (1965, \\'74, \\'78), an Emmy (1973), a Grammy (1989), two Golden Globes (1973, \\'86) and an ever-loyal fan base, something Schechter covers in monumental detail in \"The Liza Minnelli Scrapbook,\" in bookstores this month via Citadel Press, with a foreword by Billy Stritch.No stone is left unturned in looking at the career of Minnelli and, for a refreshing change, no stone is hurled at her, either; here, it\\'s strictly Liza\\'s professional life and accomplishments that the author is emphasizing. And nothing goes unrecorded, be it a TV \"Match Game\" appearance on NBC in 1967, a 1987 concert in Stockholm, Sweden, or, this year, singing \"Oscar\" and \"God Bless the Child\" at a private party at the Ars Nova Theatre in New York. Besides being a dandy reference guide for anyone hunting for a Minnelli fact,\"Scrapbook\" also includes plenty of interesting info onMinnelli projects that came close to happening but didn\\'t. She was announced, for instance, in 1975, and again in \\'77 and \\'79, to star in the film version of \"Chicago,\" playing Velma to Goldie Hawn s Roxie Hart (with, at one point, Allan Carr producing, Frank Sinatra playing the lawyer, NancyWalker as the prison matron and Carol Channing and Ann Miller as competing newspaper reporters); later, in 1992, it was rescheduled but with adifference: Lewis Gilbert was to direct, with Liza switched to the role of Roxie and Goldie as Velma.We all know how that turned out. In 1982, Liza tested for what was to be an \"Evita\" directed by Ken Russell; she sang \"Don\\'t Cry for Me, Argentina,\" causing Russell to publicly comment, \"We had found our Evita\"; the entire venture, however, was KO\\'d until it was finally made 14 years later with a different leading lady. Schechter also lists dozens of other projects thatalmost happened (\"Sunset Boulevard,\" \"The Carmen Miranda Story\") and, carrying out the \"scrapbook\" motif, there are miscellaneous color photographs, candids and reproductions of Playbill and album covers and Liza-related ads. One thing comes through loud and clear: The lady may liketo play, but she has also worked.****The NY POST -- \"PAGE SIX\" -- Sunday, November 14th, 2004 :HITS THE SPOT :IT\\'S not all bad news about Liza Minnelli, who was just hit with a lawsuit by her former chauffeur. At the book party for Scott Schechter\\'s \"Liza Minnelli Scrapbook\" tribute tome, the author announced Minnelli\\'s first theatrical movie since \"Stepping Out\" in 1991. Liza will play an offbeat self-help seminar leader who helps Parker Posey on her quest to find her G-spot, in \"The Oh in Ohio.\" It co-stars Danny DeVito and Mischa Barton.****The SECOND Review of \"The Liza Minnelli Scrapbook\" this one by Phill Hall of Boston\\'s EDGE and also to appear in the NY RESIDENT paper in a few weeks :\"The Liza Minnelli Scrapbook\" by Scott SchechterGrade: A+by Phil HallEDGE Literature CriticMonday Nov 1, 2004Just from the title alone, \"The Liza Minnelli Scrapbook\" seems predestined to find a place on the coffee table of many gay homes. But forget the stereotypical gay worship of this show biz icon and zoom in on the rich contents. Scott Schechter\\'s extraordinary tribute to Liza with a \"Z\" is brilliantly researched, lavishly illustrated and endlessly entertaining. It is impossible to come away from this book without possessing a deeper love and respect for Minnelli.Schechter breaks down Minnelli\\'s career in a neat manner: a decade-by-decade career-based mini-biography (all scandals are removed from print), followed by a chronological appreciation of Minnelli\\'s theater, film, television, recording and concert careers. Schechter uncovers a wealth of long-forgotten facts and photographs which will delight Minnelli\\'s fans: Minnelli dancing on stage with then-unknown Elliott Gould in a touring company of \"The Fantasticks,\" her simultaneous Time and Newsweek covers for \"Cabaret\" (and you thought Bruce Springsteen was the only entertainer to accomplish that?)The book is also rich with Minnelli trivia, including unlikely appearances such as a concert for the inmates of a Chicago jail (two months after she won the \"Cabaret\" Oscar). There is also an unexpectedly large amount of little-known data on projects which Minnelli either turned down (including the role of Daisy in \"The Great Gatsby\" opposite Robert Redford) or which fell apart before production began (including the film version of \"Evita\" under Ken Russell\\'s direction).Schechter is uncommonly generous to Minnelli, to the point of presenting the most glamorous and flattering photographs available; later-life tabloid photographs which show Minnelli\\'s problems with weight control are conspicuously absent. Yes, \"The Liza Minnelli Scrapbook\" is a love letter to the great star. And honestly, what\\'s wrong with a love letter to someone who truly earned the love of her fans?Citadel Press, $21.95, 228 pages****The FIRST REVIEW for \"The Liza Minnelli Scrapbook\"LIZ SMITH : NY Post -- Friday, November 5th, 2004\"DEDICATED TO Liza Minnelli\\'s artistry.\" That\\'s what it says on page one of Scott Schechter\\'s \"The Liza Minnelli Scrapbook\" (Citadel Press). This is a glossy valentine to the great star, concentrating on her long, award-laden stage, screen and recording career. The sensation of her \"private\" life is not emphasized. Tons of previously unseen photos and plenty of Minnelli minutiae. (Her first reviews, even as an awkward teen, are a thrill to read; she had style from the start!) Flip through this and be reminded that Liza is an artist, one whose commitment to her audience never wavers.****',\n",

The author footnotes many authors that have proven false themselves. An author he quotes even wrote a book about Hitler purporting him to be alive in South America. Johnson gives a lot of attention to Canaris, as the master of this conspiracy. Most don't know what this shadowy figure gave in the resistance movement. There are a lot of theories but very little actual proof. This book is unfounded in many things on the Normandy invasion.This book gives a lot of trivial facts about the Normandy invasion, but little in the way of proof of what the author alleged happened.

       " \"When I was a child, I remember watching the cartoon version of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and loving every second of it. I was suprised at how well the story was rounded, even though it had been translated into a cartoon. I had no idea, however, that the real magic of the story is told in the pages of Tolkien's masterpiece. When it was first published in 1937, the publisher and Tolkien had no idea that it would blossom and grow as it has (few authors think that their books will do as well as Tolkien's, and can only hope for the high mark which Mr. Tolkien has achieved.) Now, 62 years later, we find that it is perhaps THE most beloved book of the century.The well rounded plot and interesting, dynamic characters make &quot;The Hobbit&quot; the finist book in it's genre. Many other authors have tried to emulate Tolkien's masterful performance, but have all fallen utterly short of the high mark which Tolkien sites at. In my book, J.R.R. Tolkien will be one of the greatest authors in fantasy, and his wonderful and enchanting works will never lose their literary quality or magic.\",\n",

No doubt, Kiernan has one of the strongest, most distinct voices in weird and horror fiction today and, more importantly, she has the skill to back it up. Silk is a deliciously-written book, an absolute word-storm. I'm not used to discovering fantasy and horror authors who are willing to go beyond telling the same old, scary stories, the same safe, predicatble rubbish of vampires and murderous psychos, and chart new territories of the bizarre.

The tale is told in deceptively simple prose, in the tone of a parable, and despite its length (under 150 pages)manages to cover decades in Barabbas's life and to tell a story that is effective on several levels.Lagerkvist gives us a Barabbas who seeks more than anything else to have faith, to believe in something. That an agnostic chose to write this sad, lovely book about a character in Christian lore is itself a minor literary miracle.

       " \"This book is a great idea for New Testament Greek newbies like myself; I must say, however, that the strange, italicized font the publisher chose is a terrible choice. It's very difficult to read and takes some time to get used to certain of the letters. I can not, understand why they would do this. The actual Tanakh quotes appear in normal, upright typeface (in bold) and how I wish the rest of the text was like this. The good thing about this book is it really encouraged me to get off my rump and learn the vocab down to a much lower frequency level so I don't have to use it any more.Pages have nice gold bible trim but there is no leaf page marker attached, but it's hard to complain too much when the thing is so inexpensive. Did I mention the terrible font choice?I hope the new version coming out in August, 2007 remedies this problem.OK, here's my updated review for the 2nd edition of this book. I purchased the second version which came out in 2007.It now *does* include a leaf page marker, but they still use the same horrible font.It's like they are trying to confuse the reader.It's really just too bad. I get the feeling some bigwig at the publisher invented this font so nobody wants to change it completely so as not to offend someone but please, please, use a normal Greek font like every other Greek bible I've ever seen.This item is for students, not masters, so why try to be different than all the rest? This is definitely one instance where conformity would be appreciated.I broke down and bought the UBS Reader's Greek New Testament (a competing product).It is much better for reading. The nice thing about this one by Zondervon is it's size. It's very very thin, whereas the UBS product is as thick and heavy as my Hebrew Reader's Old Testament.In summary, the font is terrible. The paper and cover are nice, and the bible leaf is handy. If you're gonna sit at a desk and not tote the thing around get the UBS version instead. If you like to travel light, get this one.I will not buy the 3rd edition unless they use a totally different and standard Greek font.\",\n",

In ON BEAR MOUNTAIN, Deborah Smith gives us unforgettable characters in an irresistible setting, all bound together by an inextricable sense of destiny. She does destiny nearly as well as John Irving, but her voice is all her own--uniquely Southern, by turns gritty and gentle, soft and sassy, and etched with a tender irony that can make you laugh out loud or break your heart. She writes with genuine emotion and sentiment, but never stoops to manipulative sentimentality. Like her protagonist, Quentin Rinconni, she is a brilliant and sensitive artist who can instinctively find and give meaning to the complex patterns that define even the most ordinary of lives. Bravo, Ms. Smith, and thanks for another extraordinary read!\",\n",

Elizabeth was a character I could relate to. She was not afraid to stand up for herself and overcame conventions, like walking through mud to see her sick sister, Jane!Perhaps I am not the most qualified to write a review of Jane Austen's work, but I know what I like.

As always the supporting characters who populate the story are richly drawn in little strokes, but for maybe the first time in the series we get a potent villain. And while the historical context of the book is powerful, it never overwhelms the plot which is a high tension grabber. These days it seems Mosley isn't as in vogue as when he debuted, and I'm not sure this book got the critical praise lavished (justly) on peers like Lehane and Pelicanos.

       " \"This book has helped me in living out my faith in the workplace. Ross West has the hard won experience and spiritual depth needed to really be a guide to many of us in this challenging area. He addresses many areas such as responding to unethical situations and seeing spiritual value in our work/in others. He establishes a useful theology of why we work and what our work means and then proceeds to show many practical examples of how that theology can be applied in everyday work-a-day life. One of my favorite parts of the book is the simple but profound observation that we can and should view our work, no matter what it is, as ultimately helping another person somewhere. It's hard to think of a job where this is not the case and even though my technology job is somewhat removed from people directly, it does help them elsewhere. The book caused me to reflect on my work in constructive ways after years of confusion on this topic. I have already recommended the book to some close Christian friends who have the same challenges. It is not easy to find books that are as theologically sound and practical as this one. I am starting to read William E. Diehl who has also written in this area.\",\n",

This time, the New Republic recruits the Hapans to their cause and try to predict where the Vong will strike next. As a book, it advances the series, but the plot seems a bit too much like an Expanded Universe grab-bag with all of the EU references. We not only see the Hapans, but also Centerpoint Station and droids from the Han Solo trilogy. Meanwhile, Han goes looking for Droma\\'s relatives and, sure enough, finds himself in the middle of the action. Luceno spends a lot of time on these various subplots, but none of them seems gripping in their own right. At times, the plots descend into the \"silliness\" that characterized the later EU books. I thought Anakin\\'s choice at the end was particularly ridiculous. Overall though, there are enough twists to make this a worthwhile entry. The intrigue with the Hutts is great, as is the subplot involving the \"traitor.\" The best part is that Luceno really manages to trick readers and keep them guessing as to the Vong\\'s next target - an admirable trait in a series that too often spoils its surprises. Also, his writing is second to none.',\n",

Abby adjusts as well as she can but all the while she is desperate for her old life. Abby speaks in believable terms while maintaining the tone of a young teen.

The majority of human life has been destroyed by nuclear warfare before the narrative begins. Only people living in the farthest reaches of the the southern hemisphere remain alive. They too will all be dead in a matter of months as the unstoppable cloud of deadly radiation ultimately covers the entire planet.The novel features a number of Australian characters as well as an American submarine captain. As doomsday approaches, their lives are touchingly described. On the Beach contains some interesting scenarios and there are many moments of poignancy especially in the final pages.Much of the narrative contains accounts of everyday life as the characters strive to go about their business as if the end weren't just around the corner. Since everyday life isn't all that exciting, these portions of the book may be seen as rather dull.

       " \"Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs may have made the fragmented plot style popular, but Heller got there first, in this deliciously anarchic look at the madness of war. Heller mixes vivid scenes of slapstick comedy with genuinely shocking incidents without the usual jarring that is found whenever an inexperienced author attempts the same.Heller's real accomplishment is his cast of characters. Most authors just stick with one or two central characters, but Heller gives us a whole battalion of men, each with individual weaknesses and strengths. Also, unlike so many other war stories, this is truly memorable - for years afterwards you'll recall with a smile Milo's impossibly complicated scams, Natley's desperate search for his whore and Yossarian's wry outlook on life.In fact, there are only two problems with this book: firstly, as the book draws to a close, Heller appears to be in a desperate rush to get rid of his characters (presumably so that when Yossarian attempts his final escape, there's not that much tying him back). Secondly, the chapter &quot;The Eternal City&quot; is just awful - it reads like the book Adrian Mole is writing in Sue Townsend's &quot;Adrian Mole: the Wilderness Years&quot; and is so totally depressing it doesn't gel with the rest of the book.Still, two minor glitches in what is surely one of the most superlative books of this or any milennium.\",\n",

       " 'John B. Albion has taken on the significant challenge of conjecture for unexplained disappearances of four people in his first thriller/mystery novel, Beyond Fate.With this novel, Albion leads the reader along a new avenue for thrillers. His setting involves Wisconsin, mainly Milwaukee, Port Washington, and northern Wisconsin and Michigan. The Midwest has found its outlet as an intriguing location through this novel. Rather than guns and sophisticated technology, Albion uses ESP and intuition as tools against the \"bad guys.\" This is refreshing and an opening to inform the readers of these true God-given mysteries of an individual.The main character, Tim Storey (a potential cousin for DeKalb\\'s Dr. Storey?), is a modest Port Washington teacher, who receives intuitive information concerning four missing people: a college student and three commercial fishermen. With his sudden visions, Tom becomes obsessive to find these people.The winding plot takes the reader to a Clam Lake military base in northern Wisconsin where Storey is captured and interrogated. He finds himself involved in a conspiracy, meeting an enigmatic character named Palmer, who teams with Storey to solve the riddle of missing persons. The plot takes on a Mission Impossible flavor with an unknown benefactor to answer monetary problems. After reading Beyond Fate, one will look at the wandering, homeless people and wonder if they, too, have visited Clam Lake.As a reader, I wanted to continue with the novel to learn what lay ahead for Tim Storey. As a writer, I see the novel as a tremendous accomplishment for John B. Albion. Though the writing maturity is just above average, that will improve because Albion is dedicated to his profession. As an editor, I see the first half of the novel contains more intensity and stronger writing than the last half. However, those writing blips are Albion\\'s stepping stones to knowledge all novelists must tread upon. And I foresee Albion writing clearer, crisper future novels.I highly suggest mystery lovers purchase Beyond Fate. It\\'s a good read.Albion drew his plot from two unexplained Wisconsin disappearances in 1998. He includes an epilogue about these. Amber Wilde, the college student, still remains unfound, while the other, a commercial fishing boat operating out of Port Washington, Wisconsin, was eventually located on June 18, 2000, at the bottom of Lake Michigan.

With a new kitten that has severe sinus problems, Rick is ecstatic to have a new attractive client Lollie Woolfolk, who keeps throwing money his way to find out more and more about her long lost grandfather, his long ago associates and some legendary tapes known as the Blind, Crippled and Crazy Sessions. Rick's ecstation comes to an end after he works out he has been hired to track down victims for a murderer and receives a karate chop from the real Lollie Woolfolk which leaves him briefly unconscious and determined to bring the killer and fake Lollie to justice.Highway 61 resurfaced spent considerably less time than Radio Activity did with Rick in the studio or talking about classic rock albums which means an easier flowing storyline for this sequel which concentrates mostly on the PI side of things. It is by far the least surreal novel Fitzhugh has ever written and therefore the less humorous, but it still has a few surreal characters such as elderly blues players and a dim-witted drug taking killer to keep us entertained along with a funny occurrence between Rick and an ex client at a funeral.

Massive construction of a mysterious base in a remote mountain are of Cuba, detailed technical plans to a new super-weapon that is simply a drawing of his newest vacuum cleaner, etc. He claims to have recruited several agents, none of who he has actually met. All goes well (and Wormold regularly collects his paycheck), until London becomes intrigued and decides to send some help. Suddenly, one of his 'agents' is killed, and several others threatened, and Wormold is suddenly playing spy for real . . .This story is a humorous spoof of spy thrillers. Definitely lots of laughs throughout, but I'd have to say not uniquely outstanding. Makes all the spies and spy games look like Keystone Kops! The ending is particularly well done. I've only read one other novel by Greene (Stamboul Train), so I'm not positioned to characterize this relative to his other works, but this is an entertaining and easy read by one of the 20th century's greatest novelists.\",\n",

       " 'Having been slightly bored by \"Silas Marner,\" I was not expecting much gratification from this massive tome. But I had heard good things about \"Middlemarch\" from others, so I steeled myself and dug in. I was quite figuratively blown-away by the quality of writing.It is not just that Eliot is an excellent satirist, but that she makes penetrating psychological insights and crafts very well-developed, imminently human characters, who are sympathetic despite their faults. She also exhibits a brilliant mastery of the English language, describing both internal and external scenes in the most beautiful of terms.\"Middlemarch\" is not an easy read; there are multiple characters with complex relationships to one another, and the threads of their singular lives are eventually thoroughly tied up into one another. I found that keeping note cards on the family trees of the various characters was of assistance when reading. But once you have established who everyone is, the complexity of the novel is no longer a hindrance, and it may be read as lightly and quickly as any work of fiction.The plot line is interesting enough, but it is the personalities of the characters that are truly gripping. I cannot recall a single novel that has stimulated my intellect as deeply, or drawn upon my emotions as expertly, or commanded my respect as fully as \"Middlemarch.\" I cannot issue a higher recommendation.',\n",

Even some of my old altar boy Latin is stating to come back: \"Ad Deum qui laetificat, juventutem meam...\"But on a much deeper level the book is important because it illustrates very dramatically and profoundly the \"Catholic\" worldview, as distinct from even the \"Christian\" worldview and certainly from any \"secular\" worldviews.I want to thank Mr. Weigel for writing the definitive, must-read book for all Catholics. I will be recommending it to all my Catholic friends and relatives. By the way, the section of Chesterton is magnificent and well worth the price of the book itself. I hope Mr. Weigel will strongly consider for his next book an exposition of the major writings of Chesterton - making Chesterton accessible to the lay public.',\n",

This books proves that Mario Puzo does not need to write a story about the mafia to remain America's favorite storyteller.&quot;Fools Die&quot; is set in Las Vegas. It deals with four friends who all meet in Las Vegas. Jordan traveled to Las Vegas to escape his homelife where his wife was leaving him. Merlyn &quot;The Magician&quot; went to Las Vegas to take a break and relax. Cully worked for the casino and overlooked the casino floor. Diane was a hooker for the casino. The book starts with one night, Jordan starts a lucky streak. By the end of the night, he obtained over $400,000. While his three other friends made arrangements for Jordan to leave the city, Jordan pulled out a gun that he had brought, and killed himself.The book continues with telling stories about Cully and Merlyn. It shows their struggles, and how they start to recieve power. Cully becomes the casino manager's right hand man, but eventually decieves him to gain more power. Merlyn gets a job enlisting people into the six-month army reserve program. He becomes a crook by accepting bribes for people who are low on the list and do not want to become drafted into the army. By taking the bribes, Merlyn moves the people up on the list. Eventually, the FBI catches onto the scheme, and investigates. Merlyn, now a very wealthy man, quits his job.Many other great characters are met during the book, especially the world famous author Osano, whom Merlyn starts to work for.This book works on many levels. It is romance, thriller, crime, and dark comedy all rolled into one great book. Mario Puzo's genious work should be read by every person, because it will appeal to all. I hope you all read this book.To read more books by Mario Puzo, read &quot;The Godfather&quot;, and &quot;The Last Don&quot;. Both books are excellent, just as good as &quot;Fools Die&quot;.\",\n",

Tolkien\\'s first claim to fame, but it is better known as the precursor to the famed Lord of the Rings series. It is a story of struggles, adventures, and unlikely heroes in a land called \"Middle Earth\".Hobbits do not like adventures, as the famed Bilbo Baggins once said of adventures, \"Nasty disturbing uncomfortable things! Make you late for dinner!\" With the help of the far more important, but less noted wizard Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins (the hobbit) does in fact set out upon an adventure with thirteen Dwarves to return to Lonely Mountain and regain their treasure, in so defeating the cruel dragon, Smaug.They out wit orcs and goblins, battle spiders and evade elves, Bilbo finds the Ring, yes the Ring, and out riddles the morose Gollum to keep it. They achieve many things, making many friends and even more enemies before reaching old Smaug and the Lonely Mountain, and still they know not what to do about it\\'s treachery.The Hobbit was definitely not a stroke of genius, but a work of genius after years and years of writing lore on goblins, elves, dragons, dwarves, and such, such is all the great things you may have or may yet come to love in Tolkien\\'s writing. The Hobbit however, is a first in Tolkiens lore, and The Hobbit was the first taste of Tolkien much of the world got. Although over shadowed my the trilogy of the Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit is important in understanding Middle Earth, and it does it in a fun way. It is something you could teach you kids to read with, while still enjoying it yourself.The Hobbit was originally intended to be a before bedtime kids book, and it sends a very potent message to it\\'s intended victim...it doesn\\'t matter who you are, where you come from, or how big you are, even the smallest can change the world. To more extent, hopefully we are, in the end, better off, but that is a matter of opinion, for greed is the bleeder of wealth, and happiness can be found in small things, even after big adventures. I did find Tolkien\\'s style rather youthful and informative allowing me to see far in advance the come of events...nonetheless he did an excellent job in portraying the turn of events that was and is The Hobbit. His imagery and imagination are unrivalled, yes, even to those of us who saw the movie first. For those of you who don\\'t like Old English, don\\'t worry, it\\'s hardly used in The Hobbit. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to know more about the Lord of the Rings, or simple wants a good book to read to the young ones before the lights are turned out.

The book has short narrative sections that provide insight into Shaker history, work, and communal and spiritual life. One section captures a &quot;typical&quot; day in the life of the Brethren and Sisters. The enlarged font is easy on the eyes and the top of each narrative page is headed by the famous Shaker wall pegs. The narrative sections are separated by numerous pages of high quality, well-captioned color photographs of Shaker crafts, furniture, and architecture. Lots of beautiful pictures! The Shakers legacy still seems to have a profound impact on our contemporary lives in spite of (or perhaps because of) the simplicity of their work and their unusual communal way of life. Although this book does not present a comprehensive history of the Shakers, it does an admirable job of providing an insight into the lives of these interesting people. This book is deserving of any coffee table and should get a lot of attention in your household. END',\n",

But 200 pages in, it still felt like a failed promise. I was angry. I was frustrated. I was surprised--surprised his editor let this get out. This is my first book by Liss. Knowing that he'd won a book award and having read the promising first pages, I believed I'd found a well-written book. At the micro level the book is well written in that Mr. Liss has a polished, almost literary writing style. But, at the macro level, the storyline falls short. Reading it was like listening to someone who talks on and on without ever getting to the point. Or like hearing someone try to tell a joke, but they never quite get to the punch line. You could read Ch. 1-3 (53 pages), jump to Ch. 5-6 (13 pages), then jump to Ch. 32 -35 (33 pages) and enjoy all this book has to offer. You could read those 99 pages instead of the entire 386 pages and miss very little in the way of plot development. And you'd feel no torture.Most of the story is written in 3rd person, but part of it is in 1st person. The switch from one viewpoint to the other contributed nothing.Every character in the book is unsympathetic. As a reader, I was disappointed with all of them, even the minor ones. The character who elicited empathy in the beginning (Hannah) was by the end just as disgusting as all the others. BTW, the whole Hannah story contributed little to the main storyline.When I read this book, I almost put it down many times. But David Liss kept stringing me along until, finally at page 200, I couldn't stand another minute of it. So I did something I just don't do: I jumped to the last chapter and read it. Then I read the chapter before that. I began to read it backward one chapter at a time. That made it a lot more interesting. Eventually, the whole book was finished.After this, I would be disinclined to read anything else by David Liss. But I WILL give Liss another chance to redeem himself because he did, after all, manage to string me along for 200 pages.\",\n",

Ah...The fact is that Gatsby deserves its consideration as a Great American Novel. It's fascinating in language, story, and scope (as well as, you know, meaning), and it's like as American as possible. Unlike many other modernist American novels, it actually explores America in America from an American perspective. Like, it doesn't take place in Europe and it isn't about America compared to Europe. It is actually able to comment on American aristocracy as it is because of this, not as it is in comparison to other societies. So, seriously on the 'America' part of 'Great American Novel' is what I mean.I actually feel hesitant to write a review on it. Everything that needs to be said about The Great Gatsby is is the book. Everything I could write has been explained better by Fitzgerald. This is by no means a bad thing (check out my rating, come on), and in fact it's a great achievement.

The murderer was then believed to have killed him/herself The unsolved case occurred some fifteen years prior to the novel\\'s action.Ariadne refers to persons who worked or were otherwise acquainted with the deceased Ravenscroft couple as old elephants.

What a ballsy thing to do -- to take on one of the most beloved sci-fi properties in history --and attempt to bring new, fresh persepective to it.The easy way out would have been to simply plunder Frank Herbert's notes, &quot;clone&quot; (ghola?) his style and count on a hungry and sentimental audience to lap it up with an unsterilized plastic picnic spoon. But you didn't do that. You tell the story with a brisk voice and an energetic clip that suits the younger ages of the main characters (Vladimir Harkonnen has yet to become the &quot;floating fat man&quot; of his later years) and ties up all sorts of &quot;loose beginnings.&quot;I've recommended that a number of &quot;non-Dunies&quot; first read &quot;Dune,&quot; then this new prequel, then the remainder of the Dune series (which, let's all admit, grew a tad thin toward the last couple of books).A lot of self-appointed &quot;Dune Purists&quot; are rail against the effrontery of adding to the Holy Canon.

       " \"The scary thing is that actions similar to those that happen in this book could (and probably will) happen. About one quarter of the Earth's population is Muslim and a high percentage of them blame the U.S. for just about everything. Unfortunately, according to polls, about 25% of American Muslims feel the same way. So the book was both timely and interesting. But it was also very poorly written. The grammar was atrocious. As for the story, one thing that really bothered me was that basically all of the government officials from the President on down kept referring to the terrorists as ARAB Muslims. In reality, less than 15% of Muslims are Arab. Pakistanis are NOT Arabs. Indonesians are NOT Arabs. Iranians are NOT Arabs. Chechans are NOT Arabs. Somalis are NOT Arabs. Nigerians are NOT Arabs. And yet all of these groups have their share of terrorists. Another thing that bothered me is that according to the story there were about 20,000 Muslims who had been placed in the U.S. over the last twenty years to live peaceful American lives, raising families, holding down jobs, making friends and not attending radical mosques and yet NONE of them switched sides. If the number had been twenty instead of twenty thousand I might be able to accept it. But to say that the American way of life couldn't turn the hearts of ANY in a group of twenty thousand living the American Dream is not saying much for this county. An interesting book that should have been a lot better.\",\n",

       " 'Nine Nights with the Taoist Master, Deluxe Study EditionThe Deluxe Study Edition includes all 24 chapters of \"Nine Nights\" and adds an additional 110 pages of appendices and an \"afterward\". These additions are a fascinating addition to Master Waysun Liao\\'s story of Lao Tzu\\'s visit to a border town in China before wandering across the Western mountains toward India. During the visit he reveals the secrets of living in the Tao. Portions of these secrets eventually become the text of the Tao Te Ching.The importance of this story is that it lends context to the enigmatic text of the Tao Te Ching. Without this context, the interpretation of this classic will vary widely. With the context of a story, there is a cohesive vision of the eighty-one chapters of the Tao Te Ching which explain how man may live in harmony with the world and the world unseen.The\"Afterword\" is a conversation with Master Liao about interpreting the Tao Te Ching, religion, and the practice of Taichi today. He expresses a view that is insightful and controversial.Appendix 1 is a direct, character by character translation of the latest scrolls unearthed in 1973. These scrolls are felt to be the earliest record of the Tao Te Ching. This translation is keyed, line by line to references in the story. Thus a student of the enigmatic version of the Tao Te Ching can refer back to the contextual meaning given within Master Liao\\'s story. It truly gives the poetry an enriched meaning.Appendix 2 is the original text, IN CHINESE, of the scrolls. This should be invaluable should an able scholar wish to understand the basis of Master Liao\\'s translation.The third Appendix is a jewel of a glossary of 23 key terms used by Lao Tzu. Not only is the meaning of each term explained, but suggestions are made on how to incorporate the concepts into the reader\\'s meditative practice. For example Master Liao explains how to use breathing techniques to reunite the mind and body. Appendix 3 will inspire many productive meditation sessions, sessions that hopefully will lead the meditator to experience the power of the Tao.The Deluxe Study Edition is definitely worth the additional money. With the study edition, the Tao Te Ching goes way beyond puzzling poetry; it becomes instead a resource for your practice, a practice that can guide you towards a life in harmony with the Tao.',\n",

       " \"It's amazing to see how many Pierce fans have popped up over the past six or seven years. I remember when she barely wrote a book-- when the Immortals suddenly appeared so many years after Alanna, my private school practically had a festival. Tamora is a talented writer; in the Circle, she's created spectacular characters, realistic personalities. Like most Pierce fanatics, I'm a sucker for her way of dealing with swashbuckling romance-- and I must say that I haven't held any of her villians as dear as I did Roger (I'm also a sucker for bad guys). It's hard to expect that from the Circle, which is a charming read about the science of magic, not the overzealous use of it against the bad guy. These kids are against the odds of nature-- and realistic aspects of life. Reading the books are like going on vacation; Winding Circle sounds like the Mediterranean (spelling?) to me. Everything seems bright. I still have to find out what happens to Briar, but so far Daja's story, I think, is the best of the series. She makes very powerful desisions within it. But the plot is slow in this series; almost everything is taken day by day, and the parts in Daine's books where she mediated (and I almost snoozed) well, sorry, Tamora, but pretty much half the Circle is written like that. I can't really explain it. But here's a toast, for an otherwise well done young adult book.\",\n",

       " 'I have been very eager to start my child on solids and a road to healthy eating. This book was a great addition to my quest, and I would recommend it for any family wanting to encourage healthy eating habits and easy recipes.Some features I really liked: there are tips and facts next to almost every recipe which range from what kind of green beans to buy to how to alter the recipe for a toddler. Also almost all of the recipes make two cups of puree, which makes it really easy to freeze or expand for the family. Also there are is a lot of variety when it comes to time involved in cooking. Almost every recipe is easily adaptable to become a family meal. This book really inspires you to skip the hot dogs and tater tots and give your kids a nutritious meal.On the downside some recipes do include items before the recommended age to start. However this is easily adapted by just waiting a few months before using the recipe. My biggest complaint is the lack of information about starting your infant on solids. There is only one page regarding this, no recipes and few details on cereals. I guess since I am currently in that stage it bothers me more than usual.Overall I recommend purchasing this book for the great recipes, but I would still get at least one other book that talks more about the initial stages if you are starting from the beginning.

       " \"Tired of facile books on eBay? (You know, something like 'Moron's Guide to eBay'.) Are you wavering on going to buy or sell on it, never having done so? Or you are already on eBay. But you are wondering if there are ways to get better prices, where 'better' of course depends on whether you are buying or selling. Well, here is an excellent how-to manual that still keeps some objective distance from its subject. That separation lets the author offer some disinterested advice. You can best see this when Karp evaluates the various listing options available to a seller. His suggestions, especially on one option, which he considers a total waste of money, are excellent.There are some omissions that would have made this a stronger book. He offers 100 tips. But...He discusses Phishing. Which has been used against eBay and Paypal users. But, as far as I can tell, he never uses this term. He REALLY should. We can imagine new users hearing about it, wanting to know more and not finding it in this book's index and hence passing on the book. And phishing is actually more dangerous than just one bad auction.Also, he omits three important tips. Firstly, once you have sold to a satisfied buyer, you should add that buyer to an email list. Next time you offer a similar item, very politely email her about it. (Of course, drop her if she opts out.) You can also add unsuccessful bidders in your auctions to this list, though you may have to go thru eBay's mailer to contact them. He mentions keeping a spreadsheet of your auctions, including the email addresses of your buyers. But he doesn't take the next simple step.Secondly, consider first offering future items directly to previous buyers, instead of listing on eBay. If no takers, then put on eBay. This does NOT violate any eBay rules because the buyer and seller now know each other and can talk about nonlisted items. There have been reports in the media about businesses selling on eBay partly to get just such a list of customers. Of course, there is now no eBay protection for buyer or seller. But if you are a business with a website and a good eBay rating, this reassures buyers. And you, as a seller, have a defacto credit check on buyers, by looking at their ratings.Thirdly, what would have been good is a tip on when it is NOT economic to list an item on eBay. Note that I did not say 'sell'. Amongst some power sellers, there has been increasing dissatisfaction. Prices are falling, eBay raises its fees and more auctions end without any bids. If you have an item for which there is little demand, then what is the chance that within 7 or 10 days of an auction, potential buyers will go to eBay and look for it? Remember, eBay always charges a listing fee. Of course, you can lower your price, to spur demand. But that costs you. At some point, things become uneconomic. In fact, if you have specialised books with a limited audience, Amazon is a viable alternative as it levies no listing fee, albeit with a higher commission if the book actually sells.Karp is a very experienced eBay user and a good programmer. But I really do not think the greatest readership for this book is people who want to or are able to program, and they will not be enamoured by the code examples. I suspect he could have expanded greatly on the points I raised, to the benefit of that readership.\",\n",
       " '\"Meet The Tiger\" (later retitled \"The Saint meets the Tiger\") published in 1928, was Leslie Charteris\\'s first book in the Saint Saga (even though Hodder & Stoughton later pretended thatEnter the Saintwas, presumably because they weren\\'t the publishers of the former).It\\'s a useful (though not infallible) rule of thumb that if a book doesn\\'t hook you by the end of the first page, it\\'s not going to. Here are the first two paragraphs of \"Meet the Tiger\":\\'Baycombe is a village on the North of Devon coast that is so isolated from civilisation that even at the height of the summer holiday season it is neglected by the rush of lean and plump, tall and short, papas, mammas, and infants. Consequently, there was some sort of excuse for a man who had taken up his dwelling there falling into the monotony of regular habits &mdash; even for a man who had only lived there for three days &mdash; even (let the worst be known) for a man so unconventional as Simon Templar.It was not so very long after Simon Templar had settled down in Baycombe that the peacefully sedate village became most unsettled, and things began to happen there that shocked and flabbergasted its peacefully sedate inhabitants, as will be related; but at first Simon Templar found Baycombe as dull as it had been for the last six hundred years.\\'Not the greatest opening Leslie Charteris ever wrote &mdash; he was to become pretty skillful later &mdash; but quite respectable for a young man of 21 in only his third book. The character so introduced, of course, was to become the longest-running fictional hero of the 20th century.Even at this early stage, the Saint (plausibly from his initials &mdash; but you knew that) is a more well-developed, more travelled and certainly more eccentric character than his near-contemporary, Bulldog Drummond. There are few of the wilder parts of the world which he has not visited, and few of those in which he has not had adventures. He has won a gold rush in South Africa, and lost his holding in a poker game twenty-four hours later. He has run guns into China, whisky into the United States and perfume into England. He deserted after a year in the Spanish Foreign Legion (Drummond would have been horrified at the idea of joining, let alone deserting).Likewise Patricia Holm, the Saint\\'s companion in so many later adventures, is a much more interesting heroine than boring little Phyllis Drummond, who exists only to be kidnapped and rescued &mdash; someone whom the swine have got, or might get, and nothing more.The elements of the plot are pretty much the standard stuff of the day: a debonair hero for the reader to identify with; a million dollars in gold stolen from a Chicago bank by a mysterious mastermind known as The Tiger; a gang of ruthless criminals; and of course a damsel in distress. What separates this from the majority of such efforts is the way Charteris plays with these elements &mdash; tongue clearly in cheek, in places &mdash; and weaves a story that carries you along from first to last. Some of the characters (Algy, for instance, or Aunt Agatha) are so skillfully drawn that you feel you\\'d recognise them if they walked into your local pub.Other characters that recur later include Simon\\'s faithful manservant Orace, and &mdash; briefly, inKnight Templar&mdash; Detective Inspector Carn.From what I can make out, \"Meet The Tiger\" is very difficult to get hold of; but if you want to read the Saint books it\\'s worth making the effort. They\\'re definitely best if read in the right order.P.S. For a list of &mdash; and discussion of &mdash; all Charteris\\'s Saint books, see my So You\\'d Like To... Guide.',\n",

       " 'Ever wanted to re-vist the 80s and relive all the wonderful memories? Or perhaps learn about that time you might be too young to remember? Matthew Rettenmund\\'s \"Totally Awsome 80s\" is the best place to start. At just over 160 pages, it gives you loads of trivia in such areas as important world events, pop music, movies, TV shows, scandals, and other items of interest.The entire book is an easy read, since most areas are broken down into top 10-20 lists, with brief and often humorous commentary from the author. The most amusing section bar none is the \"80sSpeak: The Idioms and Idiocies of 80s speech\", which is an alphabetical dictionary of sorts outlining various 80s slang that was all the rage back them. From the teen slang (\"Rad\", \"Gnarly\", \"Tubular\"), to the annoying valley girl slang (\"Fer Shur\", \"Gag me with a spoon\", \"Spazzing\"), to the sexual innuendos (\"Do The Wild Thing\", \"Get Horizontal\", \"Do The Nasty\"). The list goes on. The book also covered more serious topics, like the greatest historical events (collapse of the Berlin Wall), and the biggest disasters (the AIDS epidemic). Also, for your reading pleasure, there is a look at the trends in fashion and art, which will either have you saying \"Oh, fond memories\" or \"What the @#$% were we thinking?\"The most useful sections are the music and movie chapters. The music chapter has a great list entitled \"The 80 Quintessentially 80s songs\", which has a list of some of the best tracks from the decade - great for people looking to get into the music and who don\\'t know where to start. The movies chapter outlines the best in action, drama, comedy, horror, and the best and worst of the decade. Each is broken down into a top 20 list for easy reference. The commentary from the author, while not overly helpful or informative, is fun to read nonetheless. Matthew Rettenmund has a very sardonic approach to looking at the topics covered, and his commentaries are like those witty captions they have in magazines. After all, this is not a textbook.\"Totally Awsome 80s\" is a fun read that you will likely revisit over and over again, either for the memories or to reference movies and songs listed therein. I\\'m sure there are other books that cover the decade better, but I have yet to find one. Though it is best appreciated by those who experienced the 80s, it is easily accessible to anyone who is interested.',\n",

In most-- if not all!-- instances, trailing double quote marks do not immediately follow the final letter or punctuation mark. Instead, they are shifted one space to the right and appear before the first letter of the next word. This frequently gives the appearance of a new character speech, when the author intends only narrative. This is compounded by the author\\'s own use of the word \\'Papa\\' in double quotes.

He tells stories about people like us. In fact, his stories are about us and the people around us.Don't be fooled by the length of his short stories, his shortest pieces like 'Neighbors' and 'Fat' are among his best (though I can't really point out any that is not his best anyway) because it tells so much in so little words.Another startling thing about Carver's stories is that it can relate to people everywhere in the world though he writes about Americans.\",\n",

This is a long book, an autobiography packed with detail covering every phase of her life. It is written in an easy, readable voice and from this reviewer\\'s perspective, comes straight from the heart. I defy anyone not to call the willingness to portray one\\'s innermost feelings and experiences--both controversial and mainstream--a brave act.Jane Fonda didn\\'t ask to be born into the glare of the public eye, but rather she was thrust there by means of a famous father who was emotionally unavailable. Further, she faced painful, everyday esteem issues and her mother\\'s suicide while the world watched and judged. She suffered from bulimia, and what she describes later in the book (through the words of Oprah Winfrey), \"the disease to please.\" Some can and have called it whining, however, in a memoir it is more accurately described as self-study and portrayal. In the end Fonda learns to \"inhabit herself.\" You don\\'t have to like her to read this book. If you enjoy reading memoirs of fascinating people, this one fills the bill.Reading this book allows one to contemplate many life issues. I thought about my own parents and siblings; growing up and fitting in; first sexual experiences; friendships; exercise; marriage; childbirth; religion; social work and my attitude towards the Viet Nam war. (Her trip to Hanoi and the aftermath--so sensationalized and misconstrued--unfolds with interesting detail and explains her motivations in a riveting fashion). But what I found particularly interesting was her insider\\'s perspective to making movies. I always wondered how actors could pull off love scenes and Fonda gives the emotional and physical details of one of her most important and noted love scenes, with Jon Voigt in \"Coming Home.\"Her second act is by far the most interesting. By the time Ted Turner comes into the picture, I couldn\\'t help but wonder how, given everything she had revealed thus far, she could have fallen for such a man. She gave up her movie career--not necessarily because of him but because she was ready to retire--and adopted another new role dedicating her time to various social causes including the important issue of population stabilization and the foundation of G-CAPP (Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention). I think ultimately the third act depicts an extremely ambitious, motivated and generous chameleon of a woman who has never hesitated to stop learning about herself and the world.One error that really jumped out is when Fonda attributes the quote describing Oakland, CA, \"There is no there, there,\" to Dorothy Parker, when the quote actually came from Gertrude Stein. While not serious enough to undermine her credibility, her editor may want to give that a second look.Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I\\'d Said.',\n",

The government has developed its own language, is at constant war with the other two superstates, and watches its citizens at all times. Each superstate has an identical government, one that is at perpetual war in order to gain complete power over its citizens. The process used to gain absolute power is one used by past, present, and future dictators, such as Stalin, Mussolini and Hitler. The nation manipulates its citizens into convenient modes of thinking. However, instead of only using propaganda techniques, they also use Newspeak and telescreens. Newspeak is the official language of Oceania, and has its sole purpose in abolishing all independent thought. This is done by drastic reduction of vocabulary, by getting rid of unnecessary words and synonyms. (Example: the word bad is replaced by the word 'ungood.') The telescreens monitor each citizen at all times, watching for any action, word, or possible thought that could be unorthodox. These two Orwell inventions were foretelling, we see the equivalent of Newspeak every day in present society when we are &quot;politically correct.&quot; Telescreens are present in nearly every business, and sometimes in our own homes. Orwell was obviously warning America and all other countries about the control of totalitarian governments. The reader is introduced to the metaphysical philosophy behind 1984. A government not unlike present ones is at the head of Oceania, and that is where the reality of 1984 becomes evident. The sole manipulative technique used by Big Brother is one that is virtually unrecognizable, mental manipulation. Metaphysics, or the belief that there is existence beyond our comprehension, is represented by Big Brother when the reader learns about doublethink, the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's mind simultaneously and fully accepting both. Doublethink and metaphysics are the engines behind the three world governments, and is defined by O'Brien. &quot;Reality exists in the human mind, and nowhere else,&quot; says O'Brien. &quot; In the mind of the Party, which is collective and immortal. Whatever the Party holds to be truth is truth.&quot; The book reminds us of what has gone wrong, what can go wrong, and what will go wrong when government becomes all-powerful. It is because of this political and social insight that 1984 is one of the best books of all time.\",\n",

       " \"Night, by Elie Wiesel is a non-fiction story that takes tragedy to another level. It really does not seem to be real, but this was apart of World War 2, more specifically, the Holocaust. This tells his story of how he survived and how the rest of his family did not.It starts when he was small, he was living a decent life, his father owned a shop. But when the Germans walked through the streets with guns in their hands, he didn't know what it meant, but his parents were getting worried. Later on, he knew exactly what it meant when the Germans passed by.He waited a long time until he was sent on a train with a very little food or anything for that matter. Not many people survived that ride, they were willing to commit suicide because the couldn't take it anymore. Another reason was because of starvation, or dehydration, most of the people there couldn't live under those conditions.When they arrived, they first separated the men from the women. That meant he had to leave his mother and his 2 sisters. It was only him and his father. It was hard, but he had to get used to it. As time went on, people had to strip themselves and run laps, and get new clothes. Then, they got assigned jobs.As time went on, his father was just getting weaker and weaker as inspections went on. You would see more people on the ground dead.Then, one horrid night, the generals told them to get out of bed in the middle of the night and run many miles in the blizzard to another camp. That night was like no other. He actually saw people die.Nothing is happy about this story. It breaks your heart, especially because it is all true. It is the perfect story to read.\",\n",

       " 'It\\'s ridiculous to review Dickens, who is as secure in the Western canon as Shakespeare. Nonetheless, I\\'ll make two points about \"Great Expectations\", which is the first Dickens novel I\\'ve read since my adolescence. (Kennedy was President, alas.)First, I\\'ll say that the characters in this book are affecting exaggerations and not quite real. For example, Joe Gargery, the blacksmith, is touching in his decency and saintly in his generosity. But Dickens gives him no rough emotional edges, and so he never rises beyond rustic sentimentality. Likewise, Hebert Pocket, Pip\\'s friend, is a lovely young man but exists in friendship with out making any demands. And, there is the resolute and controlling Mrs. Havisham and her pathetic martyrdom. Yes, she was hurt by a man. But, it\\'s hard to imagine a person living in the filth and disorder of her mansion, unless she is crazed, like a modern street person. To sum this up, I\\'d say that his characters are not really persuasive, even though they resonate emotionally.Second, I was surprised by the near total lack of visual effects in the writing. Early on, there\\'s a moment of visual writing when young Pip is in the cemetery. But thereafter, this element is all but lacking in the book. Even after several re-readings, for example, I could never quite see Magwitch tumble into the river.Regardless, I enjoyed the read and did not find it discursive or too long. Go for it!',\n",

I\\'ve watched a movie or two based on it. It could be better.Hamlet (the character) has problems. Apparently, his step-father killed his father. This obsesses Hamlet, who,also, is depressed, manic, neurotic, and fearful.

The complete Hamlet can play for over four hours, which is not good for business. Fantastic directors usually manage to get it done in under three hours. Usually, 10% or more of the lines get chopped. The play still drags. Also, usually, someone much too old plays Hamlet. Hamlet should be played by a 16 to 18 year old. So, it is easy to go wrong with this play.Nevertheless, this play fascinates us, all. Do not be satisfied with only one version of this play.',\n",

I didn't want this book to end because I had become part of the family, and you never want the family to end. It amazes me how Steinbeck can write deeply, but his writing is readable.

It appears that Pico, with the help of his Hebrew associates, and especially of Mithridates, was the first Christian scholar who attained an accurate and detailed understanding of the Kabbalistic writings and doctrines, and that he proved his originality not only in the choice he made among the manifold and often contradictory ideas, selecting those that suited his own beliefs, ideas, and preferences, but also in the way he restated these doctrines and combined them with either his own ideas or those derived from other sources.As a careful and critical scholar, Wirszubski leaves many points open or uncertain, but on many others he arrives at firm conclusions which show that many conventional or fashionable opinions on the subject are either too vague or are outright mistaken.Every serious historian of philosophy and of ideas should be grateful to Wirszubski for this solid and interesting contribution.',\n",
       " 'Many schoolboys in the developed world may know that malaria is the second largest killer of mankind in human history. (As a brief aside, the largest killer is ....... man!) I came to this book knowing very little else about the tropical disease. Yes, I knew that it was transmitted by mosquito bites, but my knowledge ended shortly after that point. Therefore I will readily admit to learning a great deal from this book ? about disease transmission and treatment in general and malaria in particular, and of the wonderful, quinine-bearing ?Peruvian bark? of the cinchona tree. The subject areas covered are enormous: combining more than 350 years of medicine, discovery, colonial conquests, papal intrigues, botany, and biological research. It whets the appetite, and shows that there is much to look into further.The huge scope is both an advantage, and a disadvantage; an advantage because it gives the reader a context, but it highlights areas worthy of greater coverage with some parts a little sparse. There is little of the effectiveness of quinine (from the ?miraculous fever tree?), when compared to modern anti-malaria drugs ? the problems of, say Larium, have been well documented elsewhere. However, the author uses her own family background to off-set the story, and the approach is particularly effective. Parts are from her own story (growing up in Africa), whilst other small portions cover that of relatives (her great grandfather worked on building of the Panama Canal, and survived the ravages of both yellow fever, and malaria).The dedication of early doctors, and plant specialists shines through, although in some sections the numerous individuals entering the story seem part of a list of people, places and dates. The telling of the mosquito life cycle, and the discovery of the effect of the insect is very good, with detail from the works of both Ronald Ross and Patrick Manson in the 1890?s. I did not realise that malaria was hitherto both so geographically extensive, and so important in war. This included both the Napoleonic wars, and the American Civil War. The life expectancy of British soldiers in West Africa in the early 19th century was less that 6 months, and was a calculated waste of life.An interesting note is the prevalence of malaria in Europe, with the fatal effects of the papal enclave of 1623; a number of the electing cardinals did not return from their Pope-choosing visit to Rome. Malaria was also very evident in the Essex marshes in the late 17th century; immune local men would go to the hills in search of another woman when a wife died in the lower (malaria infested) regions. Some men had 14 or 15 wives, but never more than one at a time. Perhaps that is where the ?Essex girl? jokes started.My overall feeling is that the book does not quite achieve its aim, chiefly because it is so hugely ambitious. It is however a very good read, and may even entice you to read further on the subject (with ample source material listed by the author). I am left at the end realising that there are still about 3,000,000 deaths each year from malaria, and most of these are preventable, whether that is using the product of the cinchona tree, or by some other means. The story may encourage people to strive for the eradication of the disease. Read it, and judge for yourself.Peter Morgan (Bath, UK. morganp@supanet.com)',\n",

Ultimately, each family has to do what is right for them. But facts be told, after 17 years in the field of pediatric cardiology, it is clear to me that the 3 stage procedure ending in a Fontan does NOT give a good, long-term outcome. The majority of the children with this surgery do well until their teen years (this is why the other reviewers with children in their school age year feel the surgery is such a success). What they fill eventually find out is that most patients with a Fontan go into heart failure approximately 10-15 years after the procedure is performed. Some undergo another surgery to revise their hearts once again; some undergo heart transplant, most children get progressively more incapacitated and ultimately die in their late teens or early 20's. If this is what you consider to be a great outcome, the surgical approach is certainly an option for you.

What I like about Plaidy's novel is that it is written in first person as a kind of memoir while Anne is imprisoned in the Tower of London, and tells her story from her own point of view.

After 200 pages - surely a fair test sample of a 1000+ page book - I hadn't found one character to root for and couldn't bear to plow through 800+ more pages with these &quot;people.&quot;From Robertson Davies' glowing review in &quot;A Merry Heart,&quot; I felt like I really had to read Powys right away! I love Davies very much, but this book is nothing like his work - it's m-u-c-h slower and much less far-ranging. It's dull, dull, dull. And the characters are one-dimensional -- either they're pathetic or corrupt.Just goes to show once again that what deeply moves one person can leave someone who loves the first person cold. Maybe you had to be born in Canada to Welsh parents at the turn of the century and reading this book in the 1930s to get it. I tried, and I couldn't.\",\n",

       " 'Asimov\\'s Golden Age classic Foundation Trilogy is one of the early milestones of the science fiction genre. This second installment is less episodic than the first volume, focusing on just two specific stories. The first volume, &quot;Foundation&quot;, sets up the whole idea of the Seldon Plan, a mathematically based view of sociopolitical forces that enables one brilliant scientist to grow a new galactic empire from a foundation of one hundred thousand scientists and their families. &quot;Empire&quot; starts off in the same vein, showing how the Foundation staves off annihilation at the hands of the currently decaying, but still dangerous Galactic Empire. Once again, the magic of this section is the subtle means by which the Foundation overcomes impossible odds, and the convincing arguments Asimov uses to make the solution seem inevitable. Part Two involves an internal struggle between the Foundation\\'s authoritarian central government and the Independent Traders who spread that government\\'s economic power. While the Foundation is threatened with civil war, the rise of a new warlord on Kalgan poses a danger to the entire human race.Because each story is substantially longer than those in Foundation, this volume focuses more on individual characters. In fact, it is not too much to say that a major theme is the historical question, \"Do individuals matter?\" As a result, the characters are developed slightly more, and there\\'s even a wistful love triangle, and considerably more action than was featured in the first volume, which tended to be distant and impersonal. If you liked Foundation, you\\'ll surely enjoy this and the climax to the series, Second Foundation.Although these books will strike many as hopelessly dated, Asimov\\'s sweeping historical vision should not be missed by any fans of speculative fiction. They have a directness and honest charm about them that is rare in contemporary science fiction. Later additions to this series, both sequels and prequels, don\\'t adhere to the tone of these original novels, and really add very little except bulk.',\n",

       " \"Robb outdoes herself in &quot;Vengeance in Death.&quot; Some previous installments in the series had become weak in plot and entertainment. This novel is just great.With each of the novels in the series, Robb delves into a different supporting character - fleshing out Mavis and Peapody in past novels, for example. Summerset gets his turn in this one.In a truly entertaining plot, Summerset is framed and Dallas is forced to take her investigation underground or risk making Roarke himself the prime suspect. The villain is targeting Roarke, and is taking out everyone who helped Roarke avenge the death of Summerset's daughter 15 years ago. And we get the added entertainment of Dallas defending Summerset - Robb adds to the previous background behind Summerset's disdain for Dallas. Unlike past novels in this series, Robb makes it very hard to figure out who the villain is and yet when we do, it's very logical.The love affair between Dallas and Roarke is finely shaped, some good sparring and making up, excellent intensity. We continue to have witty exchanges between Peabody and Dallas, and meet McNab, who will be developed in a later novel.A great read!\",\n",

As a mom, I really appreciate that this book covers a lot of what will be really happening, so that nothing really comes as a surprise to him once baby gets here - things like, the umbilical cord scab, baby crying, breastfeeding, sponge baths... etc. It also gives a thorough background of baby\\'s development, which is a key concept to understanding that at some point, Mom\\'s belly will soon give way to a sibling. The author isn\\'t vague nor does she use alternate terms for things, or attempt to \"dumb it down\" at all.

       " \"The author of these diaries was 23 when the war began in 1939, and canot be blamed for the rise of Nazism. She knew many German aristocrats, including ones who suffered the extreme penalty for opposing Hitler. I found fascinating the account of how life went on in aristocratic circles in Germany while bombs dropped and Hitler ran his terroristic regime. This is another view entirely from Victor Klemperer's monumental volumes entitled I Will Bear Witness, which I read with sheerest fascination on June 11, 1999, and April 7, 2000, since Missy, the author, almost seemed to bear a charmed life. But like Klemperer's diary, time seemed to move so slow as one reads, knowing that not till May 8, 1945 would the ordeal end--and not even then because life in Germany postwar was no bed of roses for some time. If one considers the author as the young woman she was, not one in a position to answer for the rise of Hitler or to impede his ruinous course, the diary is a moving tribute to the human spirit.\",\n",

It isn't conforting in any sense of the word, but it gives a powerful message regarding the nature of humans. The whole conflict between Jack and Ralph is petty, but that was the point. Written during the horrors of WWII, W. Golding wanted to show the readers that the only difference between human beings and beasts is that we are governed by laws and civilization, without which we do become savages. Disturbing, extremely, but that doesn't mean it isn't a good book. Someone once told me the purpose of art and literature is to make an audience think through its powerful messages, not to be comfortable to place in a &quot;hospital&quot; setting. Lord of the Flies does exactly that. Through vivid descriptions and masterful symbolism, this book conveys a powerful message regarding human nature. A previous reader claimed, due to the Columbine shootings, this book should not be read in high schools, I couldn't disagree more. It is because of such atrocious acts that the message this book contains is needed more than ever.\",\n",

       " \"Iyengar is reveered by students of yoga trained by his method, available in Light on Yoga and Light on Pranayama, practical guides that are lived with over the years. No one knows how traditional his methods are because like all else our understanding changes over time. Anyone familiar with Patangali's Yoga Sutras will know how concentrated his teaching is, or rather will appreciate that the sanskrit he taught in was a precision instrument difficult to explain to English speakers with a vast and shifting vocabulary. Patangali was not only a great exponent of yoga but also of sanskrit, the most ancient language still known, precursor of Greek, Latin and most other languages. Patanjali considered the sanskrit word for anything was sound equivalence of the thing itself. A different world, a world of sound and silence it is difficult to comprehend, to enter.Yet Iyengar has entered and lived in that world most of his life.Moreover he has a use of English that enables him to take us along with him. This is not a book to read in a day or two, which would scarcely be possible and certianly totally indigestable. It is a book to get to know in silent study, preferably a page or two a day whilst sitting in one's favourite asana. Everything Iyengar wants to convey and through him Patangali wants to convey is already part of your makeup as a person living in the world of nature around you. The Yoga Sutras were compiled to allow you to be yourself by getting to know yourself thoroughly. Although an alarming prospect at first sight it need not be under such expert guidance.It is hardly conceivable that this book would mean anything at all to anyone who has not even begun yoga training. On the other hand anyone wishing to embark on exploration and improvement of self could read this book alongside Light on Yoga, learning simple yoga at first but gaining early insight into the subject from the Yoga Sutras.Existential Buddhists will need to be tollerant of Iyengar's Hindu worship of idols (eye catching cover illustrations only) and translation of Isvara as God, these are superficial practices he, like Ghandi, adopted as their native contemporary Indian culture, harmless enough, they do not detract from brilliant lives and expositions of perennial philosophy.Great soul, great book, used as intended it is the best purchase you are ever likely to make.\",\n",

I couldn't wait for this book to end. Within the first 3rd of the book I caught myself skimming, throughout the rest of the book I struggled with the fact that I was not enjoying the story and had to force myself to read.This was a book that should have been about telepathy and mind reading, should have been a very exciting read, and could have been brilliant. Instead Simmons spends large parts of the book dropping the plot and spending page after page explaining the physics behind mind reading, and it doesn't make a whole lot of rational sense. Jumping back and forth between a plot that could have been entertaining, and a lecture on the physics of mind reading wore out my brain... especially since the physics part was completely unnecessary to the story. Then you throw in the completely out of nowhere idea that a mind reader would end up in all the different situations that occur in this book from serial killers to gun wielding Mafioso none of it came together.

       " 'The British really had it together. At the end of WWI with revolution all over Central Asia (and a lot of other parts of the world), the collapse of monarchies, and civil strife in most countries, Britain was in imperial overreach turbo mode... How to deal with all of these troubles simultaneously while retaining the Empire?Bailey gives you an idea of the kind of person, military man, cool headed, well educated, politically astute, able to command men in battle, fair and just: a reflection of a mindset that battle and force are the last resorts to settle conflict. A few good men on the ground, grinding up their shoe leather, sending out reports and defining the risk, ensured that Britain got involved only when empire and country were threatened.Men on the ground made this decision and Bailey is your classical \"our man in Tashkent\" -- the hero of Buchan novels (which sadly few read anymore). His story is one daring escape after the other, double crosses within doublecrosses, and the ubiquitous agent provocateur which could be anyone.....Bailey\\'s journey through Central Asia was to assess the status of roaming Central Power troops and bloodthirsty bolsheviks -- always wearing guns to intimidate, and always failing with our hero Bailey. Bailey is at a disadvantage because he does not often have an good idea what his govt. is doing and so he engages in light banter with Bolsheviks who ask him how he gets off on coming to the heart of Bolshevist Central Asian, Turkestan when British troops are fighting against the Bolsheviks in Archangel and Baku? Since Bailey realises that the Bolsheviks are often as scarce of data as he is, he injects doubt into the conversation? How does the Commissar know that these were actually British troops? This suffices not because the Bolsheviks buy any of it, but because they are too busy planting agents speying on him to learn his \"true\" purpose and whomsoever in the counterrevolutionary movement he may be dealing with.Still this game can only be played so long and then it is time for Bailey to hide, and hide fast as the Bolsheviks want his head. In a number of disguises our hero goes through questioning while dressed as a local, passes the bolsheviks in a purloined Austrian uniform and, moving from safe-house to safe-house and knowing how to survive in the desert, he conducts espionage against the Bolsheviks and lives a life always just one half step ahead of the bolsheviks... sometimes they were literally yards away from him....This true story by an incredibly self-effacing man has something of import for the modern world. I kept thinking that the situation at the end of the World War was at least as worse (or worse) than the present time in Central Asia and the Middle East. People in 1918 were worried Bolshevism would sweep the world order away as everywhere the objective facts seemed to support the inexorable rise of the Reds. But the British (more or less) kept their heads and deployed resources rather wisely. They built up whole generations of people schooled in the culture of the Empire. Say what you want about Imperialism in general, but the particular variant of British Colonialism engendered a respect for local languages and cultures, and a notion that there were firm limits on the extent of direct control by \"boots on the ground\" -- and if boots were not necessary, or simply too expensive then people like Col. Bailey were the men to monitor and look after British interests, by subterfuge and stealth -- they never had the luxury of overwhelming force.His tale is moving, heart thumping in detail, while being understated -- this man wanted no praise.As such I could not help thinking what went wrong and why the modern imperialists like the US lack even a single person of this ilk, and why their culture did everything possible to thwart the nuturing of such spies before 2001. The US emphasis today is upon brute and overwhelming force to shape the world its image -- it is inward looking. Bailey and his contemporary British officers realised that a good man highly educated in the local languages and cultures, aware of the world so to speak, in the right place could obviate the need for an armed expedition, look after national interests... and make for a ripping read.There is much the US can learn from men such as Bailey.',\n",

The book is dominated by two amazing and strong personalities :Dorian Gray,a character full of life, and his friend and mentor Lord Henry Wotton.The story is deliciously dark and unusual, and as far as I know this is the only novel Wilde hadever written. It provides an interesting look on the society of the time through this multi-layeredstory, and Dorian Gray is a perfect representation of the human species. The novel depicts anundeniable influence of the French Decadence movement of the late 19th century, and allows thereader to understand better why it upset the British society that was emerging from the socialconstraints of Victorianism. I appreciated the beauty of his writing style, always elegant, witha flow that looks like poetry all along the book. The conversations exchanged are also witty andpoignant.Maybe some people could find the flow of the story quite slow, or with too many descriptions,which may not give enough room for imagination. Also the text was a little small, but remainedvery readable.Anyway, I highly recommend this book. It is a great way to start discovering Oscar Wilde\\'s workthrough this book full of mystery, which still asks today this valid question: \"What are peoplewilling to sell to get eternal beauty?\"',\n",
       " \"When he died on July 21, 1957, Kenneth Roberts was working on an historical novel of the American Revolutionary War which featured the battle of Cowpens. The description of the battle which was published as the fourth volume of the *Kenneth Roberts Reader of the American Revolution* was his last piece of historical writing. It was published in an abridged version by *Collier's*, and reprinted in 1976 as a booklet by Herbert Faulkner West. West also included a five-page extract from a piece written by Roberts in 1936 and originally published in *Modern Book Collecting for the Impecunious Amateur*, describing Roberts' method of historical research and setting forth his belief that historical novelists, by the nature of their art, are often much more careful with their historical sources than professional historians.*The Battle of Cowpens* itself, an eighty-page essay, starts by describing the general context of the battle, with Clinton first occupying Charleston then leaving Cornwallis in charge of South Carolina, and Cornwallis disobeying Clinton's orders by deciding to strike at Virginia, resulting in the defeat of Horatio Gates at Camden, South Carolina. (Those who have read *Rabble in Arms* know Roberts' opinion of Gates, which he reiterates here.) The two protagonists of the Battle of Cowpens are then presented: Daniel Morgan, the leader of the American troops, whom Roberts compares to his hero of the Northern Army, Benedict Arnold; and Banastre Tarleton, &quot;an incomparable cavalry leader&quot;, who later became a member of Parliament and died in 1833, aged seventy-eight (contrary to the fictional character of William Tavington in Gibson's *The Patriot*, who was loosely based on him.)The battle itself is described in detail, sometimes polemically or in a dramatized way, with extracts from Nathanael Greene's orders to Morgan, and from Morgan's and Tarleton's own accounts of Cowpens (the latter wrote a *History of the Campaigns of 1780 and 1781 in the Southern Provinces of North America*, which Roberts used as a source.) Strategic and tactical maps are included at the end, together with a profile of the Cowpens, as relief played an important part in Morgan's battle plans.The booklet is just as gripping as an episode from the British TV series *In the Line of Fire*, with Roberts' evocative style doing the work of the computer graphics. It is definitely a good place to start for those who have seen Mel Gibson's *The Patriot* and wish to know what really happened at the battle that inspired its climactic action sequence.\",\n",

       " '1984 is extremely influential on the way we as a society label each other and our government with names such as \"Big Brother\" Orwellian and such. These names like calling someone a Nazi allow us to appear to argue but actually allow us to dodge the real issues. This is fairly ironic considering the origin of such terms. Basically 1984 is set in London in the distopian future. Orwell wrote it in response to Stalin\\'s corrupting the ideals of Socialism. He was a socialist and so was really bothered by that failure.The plot to 1984 isn\\'t so important as the setting. Basically the story follows Winston Smith. Smith harbors less than perfect views of his environment, for which he will one day be arrested regardless of his actions. Not loving the government (thought crime) is the only crime that is recognized. Hidden cameras and microphones are omnipresent in the city, included mandatory TVs which can\\'t be turned off, only show a single government station and contain hidden cameras through which \"thought police\" may monitor what is in front of the TV at any time. Social interaction doesn\\'t exist, since that would be considered weird and therefore criminal.There are three classes of people in London: Inner Party members, Party members like Winston and the proletariate, who aren\\'t watched so closely because they aren\\'t considered human. In this world Winston goes from merely not liking the government to engaging in unusual behavior. He starts by buying decorative antiques at a proletariate shop and progresses to having a girl friend, who he can only meet with in remote country side settings on account of social interaction is not allowed by the government. It is obvious to him that he will one day be taken to the Ministry of Love, a windowless building which handles law enforcement, and never fails at getting thought criminals to love the government.The novel is always dark. No happy beginning, no happy middle and no happy ending. Still it is important to read it before throwing around terms like \"Orwellian\" It has been so influential on society that it is required reading - if you want to pass your tenth grade English. Failing to read is a sign of insurgence against the government.',\n",

Not only did I think he did this very well; he had a very interesting take at explaining the great achievements of knights that do not seem to be what we would consider real. Like when knights fought giants and things of that nature, and how magic was explained. I thought it was interesting how he explained that a lot of the knights did not really do a lot of the things that they said, like kill ogres and giants, they only said they did because no one was around, and no one ever questioned the adventures that the knights told of. Another cool thing was how he incorporated newer technologies, like gunpowder, into how he did his \"magic\" and made people believe that he was a great sorcerer. This was a very good and interesting book, and I would recommend it to anyone.',\n",

Confusion, site of the latest gold rush, is days old only and composed of tents and quickly nailed-up frame buildings. The prospect of gold will draw in the honest, hard-working sorts, but also them wild elements. Restless drifter and notorious gunfighter Matt Coburn was only passing thru and didn\\'t want no part of Confusion. But he\\'s got a reputation for cleaning up ornery towns, and when push came to shove, he didn\\'t have it in him to turn his back on something that desperately needed doin\\'. Now Matt Coburn, reluctant town tamer, wears a badge in Confusion and staring down all sorts of mean pistoleros, knife artists, cardsharps, claim jumpers, and drygulchers. Matt Coburn is calling himself all kinds of fool.The blurb on the back of my battered paperback touts it as a \"hairtrigger action western,\" and that\\'s no fib. THE EMPTY LAND is one of Louis L\\'Amour\\'s most exciting novels. That\\'s saying something because this author\\'s stories are never ever these sluggish melodramas. No, his yarns are lean and action-packed. They are hellaciously good reads. This time out, L\\'Amour seems to write with even greater urgency. He provides fascinating insight into how a boom town is established. He delves into the steps required to transform a reckless boom town into a decent and thriving community.Running parallel to the narrative\\'s breakneck suspense is a thoughtful examination of the ethics of killing. From jump, several of the citizens are averse to fighting violence in kind, instead advocating a more peaceful resolution. And it\\'s not as if Matt Coburn himself hadn\\'t pondered this very same thing. He\\'s aware that he\\'s in danger of transitioning from a good man with a gun to a ruthless gunman who sees killing as the first option instead of last. Louis L\\'Amour will habitually sneak in a morality play. This enriches the story, as do L\\'Amour\\'s frequent forays into imparting history lessons on the reader. But this is done so disarmingly and these nuggets of trivia mesh so well with the narrative that it doesn\\'t at all feel intrusive or jarring. L\\'Amour\\'s love of the American Old West is infectious.

       " 'Many readers focus on the Theogony, which is the ancient Greeks Creation Story, and which Hesiod articulated masterfully. The descriptions of the battles between Zeus and the Titans made for vivid and stirring oration in the hands of a great speaker, as he boasts that he was by citing his awards. However, I was more intrigued by Works and Days. The advice of Hesiod was, indeed, sagacious: \"It is good to take from what is available, but sorrow to the heart to be wanting what is not.\" And I liked this one: \"Right gets the upper hand over violence in the end.\" At times he seemed like Thoreau incarnate preaching industry and self-reliance from his little cabin on Walden Pond: \"Avoid shady seats and sleeping til sunrise at harvest time, when the sun parches the skin. At that time get on with it and gather home the harvest, rising before dawn so that your livelihood may be assured. For the morning accounts for a third of the work.\" Or this one: \"For property is as life to wretched mortals.\" Some of his advice is quaint, as when a man should take a wife. The thing of it is that so much of what passed for wisdom in ancient days would still pass for it today.',\n",
       " \"The first time I read this book was when I was nine years old. I hated it.The second time was last week, at the age of nineteen. The first thing I noticed about &quot;The Hobbit&quot; was that, to start with, it was surprisingly childish. Not surprising, as it is a childrens' story. However, athough I have never read Lord of theRings, I could sense something bigger behind the story. It was inexorable. Towards the end of the story, the tone changes dramaically (around Chapter 14). Quickly, the language becomes almost biblical in style, eg: &quot;Thorin bent his horn bow and fired an arrow at Dale; it smote in his shield and stuck there quivering&quot;. The juvenile language all but vanishes, and a grand epic feel is created. The character of Thorin is most memorable. This is a masterpiece.\",\n",

This collection of stories is as fresh and clean as the outdoor worlds it so amazingly describes. Often, I found my mind wandering off the page, and rather than stop myself and turn back to the book, I let my thoughts linger on. The book is nostalgic in this way. It reads quietly and naturally. I felt myself living in Andrea Barrett's vivid landscapes, and communicating with her eccentrically human characters. How rarley in a book do you find two characters, both very likeable, dislike each other? Yet, how often do we find this in real life?In the second story, The Forest, as well as its companion, The Mysteries of Ubiquitin, opposing characters are quietly clashing almost all the time. Imagine two people, polar opposites, totally disgrunteled with each other, sitting comfortably on a patio near a swimming pool.I can not recommend this book more emphatically. For those of you who are scared of short stories... stop, and read this book.

Both are presumed dead, but Tanya had really managed to survive and begin a new life in the States. Now, eight years later, she is finding herself called back to the Venezuelan jungles to find out what really happened to her family and her darling Shannon.Meanwhile, the full plot of the drug plots takeover is revealed. More than just drugs, Tanya's family's plantation is now going to be the home of a terrorist cell intent on attacking America. To stop the terrorists and unravel the mystery of her past, she'll have to work with a rogue CIA agent called Casius who has more than one secret he's not telling. It all hurtles forward to a stunning conclusion that speaks volumes on the themes of love, loss, and the power of prayer.Quite honestly, this novel is probably the weakest of the three. While it's certainly well-done, its tone and focus are slightly different than its two predecessors. This is most likely attributed to the fact that was adapted from Dekker's first (and unpublished) novel To Kill With Reason. It lacks a certain gravitas the other books carried and seems a bit disconnected from the scope of the rest of the trilogy. It doesn't fit seamlessly, but Dekker makes it work well. It's a solid book as a standalone, but comes off a bit lackluster compared to the brilliance of the first two novels. Dekker would later polish up some aspects of this story and later use the core fundamentals in novels such as Thr3e and Burn. All in all, it's another solid offering for Dekker, and served to springboard him into the success he found beginning with 2004's Circle Trilogy.\",\n",

       " 'No one can deny that the Stranger is a modern masterpiece. This review deals not with the merits of the work, but with the merits of the publication policy that forces teachers of this classic to adopt a new translation of stop teaching the classic.One can also not deny that the Ward translation offered to us by Vintage as the only available translation of the classic is competent. This review is also not meant to be an attack on Ward\\'s translation. It is, however, in my view, markedly inferior to the previous Gilbert translation as a work of art and in conveying Camus\\'s spirit and intentions to modern readers. I recognize that this evaluation is open to debate among intelligent readers. The point of this review is that scholars and teachers of the book should be able to make the decision as to the relative merits of the translations by themselves, for reasons germane to the artwork, not publishers for reasons that have more to do with money.When a publisher comes out with a new translation of a classic, they have an obligation to leave the old translation in print, or allow it to be published elsewhere, to allow readers to choose for themselves.It is a travesty that a generation of readers instead of feeling the power and strangeness of the opening lines of the novel, \"Mother died today, or maybe yesterday ...,\" will instead wonder what Maman is and what a strange word it is to American ears.It is an even greater travesty that the publication of classics in translation has become like the publication of other textbooks, with a new edition forced upon us every few years for monetary reasons. The fans of Ward\\'s translation should not be happy about this trend either. When the expiration its copyright appears on the horizon, or when too many used copies of it accumulate in college bookstores, we can expect it to share the same fate as Gilbert\\'s.Faculty teaching this classic, no matter what their choice of translation, should not stand by and allow their choice of texts to be taken out of their hands.',\n",

I decided to reread it and see what additional insights it would bring into my life. It was clearly worth the few hours of my time it took to read this book. The device Lewis uses is very clever and forces one to look at sin, pride, and mediocrity from a totally different viewpoint. It becomes clear that it\\'s not the big mistakes we make in life that really hurts us; sometimes those are the things that cause us to reevaluate our lives and repent. The things that really hurt us are the pride and the accumulation of little sins. Lewis seem to really be pushing for greatness of soul. Bottom line is this little book made me think about my life. That is what a good book should do.The book also includes the essay, \"Screwtape Proposes a Toast\". This was written much later and instead of Screwtape writing letters advising Wormwood, he is at an awards ceremony at the school for tempters proposing a toast to future and past successes. It is basically a vehicle to complain about how the modern education system focuses on mediocrity. It also brings out some very good points to ponder.I highly recommend this book to everyone.

       " 'Walt Disney is unarguably the single most important cultural figure of the 20th century, even today still known as \"Uncle Walt.\" Such a figure is important to know, and as Gabler points out Walt Disney is a hard person to get to know. He kept few close friends throughout his life and at the Disney company he increasingly seculded himself as the company grew. This is the first biography the I\\'ve read on Walt Disney\\'s life, and I really enjoyed it. There is a lot of detail in there and it reminded me of the Theodore Roosevelt books written by Edmund Morris. Of course the Morris books are more detailed. Roosevelt lived five fewer years than Disney but got two extra books.It\\'s hard today to view Walt Disney as a person. If you visit a Disney theme park or really have any view of the man today he is held up almost as a demi-god. His likeness is in statues around the world and seeing his image or even hearing his voice can get Disney fans into a religious-type fervor. The book was well balanced, showing the struggles and vices that Walt Disney the person had along with his amazing accomplishments. For everything that Walt Disney did, he was still just another person (albeit a particularly driven one). I would suggest this book to anyone interested in learning about Walt Disney\\'s life. The only thing that I felt I didn\\'t like about the book had nothing to do with the author. Walt Disney passed away from lung cancer right at the moment when he was on the verge of the greatest project in his life- Disney World and particularly EPCOT (the one that wasn\\'t built). The book builds up everything that Walt Disney was doing for years in order to prepare for the construction of EPCOT and Disney World, but unfortunately Walt passed away before this final dream was realized. For me at least it gives the book an unfinshed quality- as if there is a chapter or two missing at the end (which of course there are).',\n",

       " 'It\\'s hard to describe Charles Frazier\\'s debut novel, as it\\'s like nothing else I\\'ve ever read. The only other book that I\\'ve ever had trouble reviewing has been theThe Complete Conversations with God (Boxed Set), a series that makes for a rather awkward comparison considering it belongs in another genre altogether. The similarities between the two lie in the uniqueness of how the tales are told.I\\'ll start by saying that I watched the movieCold Mountain (Two-Disc Collector\\'s Edition)starring Nicole Kidman and Jude Law before reading the novel, which in hindsight, actually turned out in my favour. On reading the book I found myself captivated by the beautiful language and mellow pace of the story, something that was obviously lost in the film adaptation. Despite the film giving away the most important details of the plot, the change in the method of which the story was told meant that there were still several pleasant surprises to experience on the way. In particular, the romance between Inman and Ada is much more poignant and has a lot more weight when compared to the (rather flimsy) treatment of their love story in the film.Inman is a soldier who should be dead from his neck-wound, but who survives and decides to desert in order to return to his beloved home on Cold Mountain, North Carolina, where his love Ada is waiting for him. On the journey home, Inman struggles against the dangers of a war zone and the weakness of his own healing body, meeting several intriguing characters along the way who either help or hinder him. Meanwhile, Ada (a socialite who finds herself stranded in the middle of nowhere after her father\\'s death) struggles to maintain the derelict farmhouse she inherits. Thankfully, the help of a drifter named Ruby means that Ada gradually sheds her upper-class ways and learns how to live on the natural rhythms of the land (though she does manage to introduce Ruby to some English literature in return!)With two such different stories, it\\'s inevitable that some will enjoy one character\\'s progress over the other. Much has already been said on Inman\\'s Odyssey-like journey from the war to his home, but I found myself intrigued by the precarious situation that Ada finds herself in. Coming from such a wealthy and stable background, Ada has too much pride to return to her relations, and instead finds herself forced to become a laborer on her own land. Finding that her education, culture and social etiquette is completely useless in her new surroundings, Ada learns to live off the land - and Ruby considers it an achievement when Ada stops taking a book out into the fields with her (although Ada does manage to introduce Ruby to literature in the evening, including - you guessed it -The Odyssey (Penguin Classics)).It is tempting to describe the book as a \"Civil War book\", given the historical background of the story itself, or as a \"love story\" considering the relationship between the two protagonists. Yet the novel is neither of these things, despite the fact that \"Cold Mountain\" centers around the themes of both love and war. As others have already mentioned, reading this book with the expectation of aGone with the Windtype-story will lead to disappointment. Furthermore, the fact that the Inman and Ada spend most of the novel apart means that their initial courtship is told in mainly in the reveries of the two characters.The Civil War is just the necessary catalyst to put our protagonists on their paths toward personal growth, understanding of their place in the world and a sense of peace. Technically, the Civil War could be any war. (Well not really, considering the care and detail that Frazier puts into describing the geographical beauty and culture of America\\'s south, but that\\'s beside the point). Likewise, the love between Inman and Ada is the goal that each are moving toward, but it is the symbol of home and stability that each personify to the other rather than a sense of \"epic love\" that make up the real basis of their relationship.My point is, that this isn\\'t a book about the historical impact of the Civil War or even a star-crossed lovers\\' tale. It\\'s about the impact a war has on a select number of human beings, and how they deal with all the terrible consequences it has on the daily routines of life. Set against the chaos and destruction of war is the steady rhythm of nature and the turn of the seasons: inexorable and unchanging. And yet, that is simply *my* reading of the text - in a novel this rich and dense, there are endless possibilities for interpretation and understanding.The language is what really draws you into the novel; it is poetic and dreamy without becoming pretentious or getting in the way of the plot itself. Even when Frazier draws out the story out into flashbacks or characters\\' reveries, there\\'s always something interesting to be learnt. There are a few odd stylistic choices, the most obvious being that there are no speech marks. Instead, dialogue throughout the text is punctuated by a dash. However, since this technique is neither necessary nor distracting, there is little need to dwell on it save to point out that it\\'s there!One thing I will say though, in the inevitable comparison withGone with the Wind. When reading Margaret Mitchell\\'s novel, I felt that I was reading a part of history, something that happened a long time ago in a world that had long since disappeared. Frazier\\'s novel however - whether by intent or accident - makes the Civil War feel like something that happened in my own lifetime. The characters and their lives are so immediate that I had to keep reminding myself that had Ada, Ruby and Inman been real people, they would have died hundreds of years ago. That thought surprised me.',\n",
       " \"While some have written that this book has not presented any new concepts, I believe what makes this book interesting is not its new concepts in marketing, but rather its 'approach' to existing concepts.What the author advocates is not only an intregrated approach to marketing, but also one that has measurable financial responsibility. The lessons may be simple, but unfortunately they also can be all too easy to lose sight of in day-to-day practice. I believe this is a good book for decision makers as an impetus to help re-center any company's approach to marketing.Additionally, I believe this book is just as good, if not better for young marketing people out there. At the end of the day, if a business does not make profits, obviously it's out of business. Marketing people that have profitable sales rather than sales alone at the forefront of their day-to-day focus are going to be that much more at an advantage to not only bring success to a company, but also to further their own careers.For the price charged, this book is a great investment provided the approach is carried through in actual practice throughout a business.\",\n",

       " 'This book is both a wonderful introduction to the psychological frameworks of Buddhism and Yoga (B&Y;) and--most importantly--a practical guide to applying these systems to develop greater emotional maturity and overall wellbeing. According to Levine, the path to mature happiness developed in the ancient philosophies of B&Y; requires calming one\\'s conditioned beliefs and \"passions\" to allow greater control by the \"anterior mind\" (the \"mind\\'s eye\" capable of observing, contemplating, and directing the mind). At the extreme, an \"immature\" individual is entirely conditioned by his or her culture, language, and biology--yielding the positive functions of anterior mind nonfunctional. Much like a little child, such a person\\'s mental state is completely at the mercy of the external environment. He/she feels alright when a craving or ego desire is fed--but falls into tantrums and anguish whenever a craving or desire cannot be satisfied. Moreover, perception and interpretation of external events are distorted by the conditioned mind and its many unchecked passions (ego needs, cravings and attachments, fears and aversions, antipathies and resentments). The result is a life filled with suffering and illusion.Fortunately, children typically do learn to moderate their most selfish behaviors as they grow to adulthood: \"[P]art of growing up entails learning some self-transformation\" (p. 54). Nevertheless, Levine points out that our American vision of \"normal\" allows for a mix of mature and immature behavior. \"Normal\" adults experience disquieting feelings (anger, pettiness, impatience, envy) quite regularly: e.g., when \"stuck\" in a traffic jam or when passed over for promotion at work. Because such unhappy events are common, many of us spend a great deal of time and energy feeling upset about one thing or another.Levine points out that we don\\'t have to live that way. Through the cultivation of positive attitudes (harmlessness, truthfulness, trustworthiness, sexual restraint, nonmaterialism) and practices (mindfulness, yoga poses, meditation), the anterior mind is freed more and more to reflect upon one\\'s own mental processes and even transform them for the better. Thus the daily agitations diminish and we feel a greater sense of equanimity and happiness.Viewing these ancient philosophies through the lens of American \"positive psychology,\" Levine succeeds in developing a powerful \"Yogic\" model of cognitive processing that shares much with Albert Ellis (e.g., A Guide to Rational Living), Aaron Beck (Cognitive Therapy and the Emotional Disorders), David Burns (e.g., Feeling Good), and Martin Seligman (e.g., Authentic Happiness). As such, this highly readable book makes a major contribution to American \"Cognitive Therapy.\" But while mainstream cognitive approaches are limited to diverse techniques for coping with irrational thoughts or troubling events, the Yogic approach described by Levine is comprehensive and holistic. I have began working with these ancient ideas and practices -- my early results suggest a potential to transform every aspect of one\\'s life (mental, emotional, spiritual)!',\n",

It may all be a dream as the &quot;Author's Note&quot; which precedes this 100 page text describes the narrative as an &quot;insomnia&quot; and a &quot;search for a shadow&quot;. You can make of that what you like but those evocative sentences only partially set the tone for Tabucchi's book is a playful series of encounters that his unnamed narrator-protaganist has with fellow travelers and interesting Indian characters along the way to finding a missing friend. The several encounters read like enquiries, but pleasant ones, and ones with philosophical as well as humorous overtones(in one encounter identity is compared to a suitcase). Some of the sequences are so strange you think it all must be a dream as when a female thief breaks into the narrators hotel room only to be invited to stay the night. Other meetings are full of a very engaging and speculation rich kind of conversation as in the meeting with the Hugo and Pessoa quoting eastern intellectual. If it is all a dream it is a very literate one. The last meeting takes place in the old Portugese port of Goa and there the narrator meets a lovely charming stranger to share a dinner with as he waits for a chance to spy a glimpse of his old searched for friend. But as they eat the narrator relates his &quot;story' in a way that makes one suspect there was no one and nothing to search for after all(modern fiction indeed it is).

We may desire to look over this fact in that much of what Mannix writes in Freaks seems to be of great personal value and experience though it may not alleviate the strain. Daniel Mannix handles his subject matter comfortably. The pictures are often helpful, though sometimes graphic. The greatest complaint that I hold in regard to the pictures is that they seem to be somewhat disorganized in relation to the text; it is often helpful to place photographs of your subject matter with the text of your subject matter as opposed to the apparent alternative. Another point to make in the overall organization of the book is that it is sometimes redundant as Mannix tends to repeat information in latter chapters that he had already provided in former ones.Freaks grants us a view of freakdom from the end those who are labeled as freaks due (generally) to a condition retained from a birth and existence that does not conform to the norms of our idea of normal. Some of those highlighted within the text are monstrously obese, others have three legs, a few even have two heads (or faces, such as Edward Mordake ), and still, Mannix tries to reveal these to live in some sort of paradox wherein they are the same while remaining unequivocally different than all of the world. One of the biggest points that Mannix tries to get across is that this difference has been, for centuries past, the livelihood for many of these freaks. From the times wherein they were found to be bound to kings and courts to the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries as depicted in circus sideshows and carnivals, \"freaks\" have made fortunes by taking advantage of their mutated traits. The delineation may have been unknown, and yet their popularity as well unmatched by what other forms of \"entertainment\" existed during their time. The information provided, though seemingly first hand or closely networked, does not seem to be well researched or annotated. On the basis of this, we may not necessarily retain that Mannix\\'s text is necessarily reliable nor may we ascertain that many of his stories of freaks past are essentially true (he even said that some of the stories were questionable). As a very general and entertaining work, this book may suffice. As an informative source, it does provide more information on freaks than I have personally read anywhere else (though I have never read any other works on freaks). This book has worked well to help whet my mind in the area of freaks, though I still think it a bit sketchy in the area of reliability.',\n",

       " \"Peter Maas gives us a tale that brings the heretofore unknown Swede Momsen to the forefront of the American heroic tradition. In describing how Momsen performs the first deep sea rescue of a marooned submarine crew, Maas tells a first-class tale. He describes how Momsen became one of the Navy's best officers, often not by blindly saying &quot;yes,&quot; but more often by challenging conventional wisdom and practicing relentless innovation -- even when it was not welcome or understood. He risked his life many times. The rescue of the crew of Squalus off the Isles of Shoals, New Hampshire, is enough of a story to merit a place for Momsen. But Maas proceeds to describe Momsen's entire naval career, which includes a hand in bringing about nuclear submarines and even a stint at solving the worst problem in the entire fleet -- namely, bringing order to the Navy's worldwide mail. Momsen has been dead for more than 30 years, but his life and work are a story about leadership, innovation, practical organization politics, and being personally effective. It's a great book, a real page-turner. The only drawback is an occasional spell of technical briefing which produced nothing more in me than a desire to skip a few pages and return to the spellbinding story of this man's life's work.\",\n",
       " \"I picked this up when I couldn't find anything else I'd rather read that I hadn't read already after finishing my last book. So, I wasn't expecting much. Having said that it was pretty good. But a lot of it just seemed far too unrealistic.First, the characters were completely unbelievable. Not that they were poorly developed, or anything like that, they were just too perfect. The two main characters, especially. They simply never made any mistakes. They were very likeable and well written, just not at all plausible in their perfection. By the time I was halfway through the book, I fully expected them to run against each other for President, only to find that they had tied, and deciding that they would govern jointly. Well, that didn't happen, but I wasn't far off.Also, I thought the way the perfect characters reacted to two particularly important events in the story just didn't feel realistic at all. I would say more, but can't really without giving anything away.Having expressed those pretty significant reservations with the plausibility of the book, it was pretty good otherwise. The characters despite their apparent perfection were well developed and interesting, and the plot was pretty compelling.I'm not really sure if I'd recommend this to someone with somany other great books out there, but if you like Jeffery Archer already, or you don't mind the unrealistic characters, then you might just like it.\",\n",
       " 'Over the past few months I have been reading, or re-reading, all of Anya Seton\\'s works, and I just finished re-reading My Theodosia, which I first read several years ago. One of the things I like about Anya Seton\\'s historical \"biographies\" is that, rather than write about the popular figures who are already the subject of countless biographies, and whose stories we already know, she instead focuses on the lesser-known minor players of history. My Theodosia, Devil Water and The Winthrop Woman all tell the stories of people that history has largely forgotten. It is probably even likely that Katherine Swynford wasn\\'t so well-known to the general public until Anya Seton wrote a book about her.In My Theodosia, Seton\\'s first book, she points her pen at Theodosia Burr Alston. Although the book is about Theodosia, the real \"main character\" of this story is actually Theodosia\\'s relationship with her father, the scheming, self-serving, but fascinating scoundrel Aaron Burr. Their father/daughter relationship was truly remarkable; while Burr was in many ways ahead of his time in his views of women, and in the way he raised and trained his daughter, at the same time he maintained a Svengali-like hold over her throughout all of her short life. She ultimately sacrificed everything -- even her chance at true love -- on the altar of devotion to her father.I think what will be most troublesome about this book to modern readers is the way Seton depicts slaves in the South (\"protruding lips around enormous white teeth, slate-back skin, and rolling eyes\") and her frequent use of the \"n\" word. I had to remind myself that she was 1) presenting blacks as they probably would have seemed to an upper-class young girl from the North in the days when slavery was still an ingrained institution in both North and South and blacks were widely considered less than human, and 2) this book was written in the 1940s, long before the days of civil rights or sensitivity to such issues.My Theodosia is a charming peek into upper-class American life in the very early 1800\\'s, and the author weaves in vignettes of some of the early American greats (James and Dolly Madison, Thomas Jefferson, Washington Irving). Seton managed to paint a vivid picture of the time and place without fulsome or verbose descriptions, a style she maintained throughout all her books. Aaron Burr\\'s escapades fill the book as they filled his daughter\\'s life, and woven throughout is a bittersweet love story of Theodosia and the true love of her life. Although this is not Anya Seton\\'s strongest work, it is highly enjoyable.',\n",
       " \"_Priveleged Son_ manages to hit that sweet spot that so many biographies of business figures fail to capture-- it manages to be a very good look at a business and industry and at the same time be readable and enjoyable on the level of a novel.While ostensibly a biography of Otis Chandler, it gives a fascinating look at the rise of a newspaper as local empire and the same newspaper's (largely unsuccessful) efforts to translate that into a truly national business.Without any industry focus, the story of the Chandlers and their relationship to LA is the stuff of novels (pulp fiction and true romance)-- LA grows up with its paper in this book.I was particularly fascinated to read what happened at the paper under the direction of Mark &quot;Cereal Killer&quot; Willes.

       " \"Angela's Ashes is a novel based on the misfortunes of Frank McCourt's childhood through early adulthood. McCourt narrates his poverty filled childhood in Ireland. Angela's Ashes became popular because of the way McCourt told his story. The book is full of humor accompanied by the horror, and is told in an emotional, vivid manner. McCourt's life begins in Brooklyn. His family is penniless, and moves back to Ireland, where he spends the rest of his childhood with his mother's family. Angela, the mother, is the backbone of the family. But even at home, Angela's family rejects her because of her marriage to Malachy. Malachy is from the Protestant North, while Angela's family is from the South. Also, Malachy is not able to hold a job, and frequently spends any money he earns on alcohol.Young Frank can do little but sit back and watch as his family moves around and siblings die. As he ages, he begins to realize the situation he is in. The overall mood is distinguished by the dark settings. Every house the McCourts live in is in shambles. It is constantly raining. They were forced to beg for food and other necessities because they were unable to financially provide for their family. Frank endured poverty and starvation with only strength and his optimism on life. His schoolmates teased him about his ragged clothes. Through all the loneliness, McCourt manages to instill a ray of hope.Frank and his brothers and friends manage to find humor and hope despite of all their troubles. For instance, when the boys were playing outside, McCourt stated that the women stand because, all they do is take care of the children, clean the house, and cook. But, the men sit because they spend their time discussing the problems of the world and wondering what to do with the rest of the day (107).This is a humorous, almost satirical look at the traditional male-female roles in a family. His unconditional love for his father starts to be uncertain. Here, Frank decides that he will do what he can to escape this poverty and leave for America when he is able to do so. By the time Frank reaches his teenage years, he is the man of the house, and his dreams of going to America are closer than ever.Through perseverance and determination he eventually raises enough money to travel to America and break free from his depressing childhood. Frank learned to depend upon no one but himself, and with willpower he was able to achieve what he had dreamed of for so long. Frank is a bright student, and realizes that he can rise above the poverty and better himself somehow. Angela's Ashes is an inspiring novel with descriptive images that help to shape his fascinating tale from hardship to victory.\",\n",

The book is a curiosity to me, it is such a pretentious affair, and yet so \"slow,\" so sleepy; such an insipid mess of inspiration. It is chloroform in print. If Joseph Smith composed this book, the act was a miracle -- keeping awake while he did it was, at any rate. If he, according to tradition, merely translated it from certain ancient and mysteriously-engraved plates of copper, which he declares he found under a stone, in an out-of-the-way locality, the work of translating was equally a miracle, for the same reason.The book seems to be merely a prosy detail of imaginary history, with the Old Testament for a model; followed by a tedious plagiarism of the New Testament. The author labored to give his words and phrases the quaint, old-fashioned sound and structure of our King James\\'s translation of the Scriptures; and the result is a mongrel -- half modern glibness, and half ancient simplicity and gravity. The latter is awkward and constrained; the former natural, but grotesque by the contrast. Whenever he found his speech growing too modern -- which was about every sentence or two -- he ladled in a few such Scriptural phrases as \"exceeding sore,\" \"and it came to pass,\" etc., and made things satisfactory again. \"And it came to pass\" was his pet.

I enjoyed his portrayal of cross-cultural communication mishaps, as well as the humor with which he presented Baba Yaga.Card also manages the multiple story-lines and viewpoints quite well, giving us a fresh perspective on almost every scene in the novel. This deft handling of characters and stories provides a fast-pace feel even in places where the story is slower.Overall, the story flows rather quickly, although some scenes seem to drag a bit. The characters are sometimes a bit unbelievable, although the more unrealistic characteristics are explained away with ease, if you're willing to accept the explanation. Card enjoys theorizing about the linear relational affects of time travel, with characters musing about how their past and present lives will intersect given certain actions.Ivan and Katerina's relationship develops slowly, but begins taking off with the crossing of worlds. Destiny has a strong hand in pushing them together, seemingly setting up their entire lifetimes so that they may meet, divide, and conquer all threats surround them.

       " 'This is not a novel at all; but a poor puppet show displayed by a clumsy puppeteer, a man who has an impressive grasp of English language but unfortunately is not in touch with reality.The novel is about Elizabeth Archer, a young, attractive and intelligent American Miss, who happens to have her own mind: nothing wrong with this portrait, so far so good. However, Henry James makes the fatal mistake of writing about things which he does not know. Right at the beginning of the story an English lord is introduced, handsome, athletic, cultivated and very rich, the arch type of ideal Victorian masculinity, the type every woman has a vague picture of in her fantasies, but unable to paint in full. He falls in love with the penniless Miss Archer and proposes to her. He is rejected. Our heroine cannot find any faults, but cannot imagine him as her husband. This is not unusual; women have their own minds, tastes and idiosyncrasies. Men have no logical explanation for the feminine taste. The English lord disappears, only to return later in the novel: this time ready to propose to another poor American girl, Miss Osmond, who, like our heroine, cannot picture herself married to this Victorian ideal. Then there is countess Gimini, Mr. Osmond\\'s sister, another penniless American woman married to an Italian count. And last, but not least, one has to mention Mr. Osmond, who wins the heart of our heroine, but ends up disappointing her. There are several other characters, but three are worth mentionening: Miss Stackpole (here James is in his own element, depicting an independent, yet traditionally sentimental American woman), Mr. Goodwood, the ardent lover of Elizabeth Archer, who seems to have no other purpose in life than run after a woman who has decidedly rejected him and beg for her hand. Mr. Goodwood is portrayed as the athletic type with a large square jaw, a visible sign of a determined, firm character (back then the pseudo-science of physiognomy was in vogue, and a firm sqaure jaw was a shore indication of a firm character).Has anyone ever heard of a handsome rich English lord going around and proposing to penniless American girls? Has anyone heard of an Italian count marrying a poor American woman? Now Mr. Osmond and Madam Merle: Has anyone ever heard of an American father threatening his daughter with penury and imprisonment in an Italian convent? Has anyone ever heard of an American woman calling herself Madam Merle... Madam?Henry James is the final product of mediocrity supported by everything money can buy. He has no originality; he is sophomoric at his best. In his eagerness to become an English gentleman he has forgotten what it means to be an American. \"The Portrait of a Lady,\" acclaimed as a classic and a masterpiece, is nothing but an empty puppet show. Despite all my efforts, constantly repressing every impulse not to throw the book in the garbage, I could not go beyond page 484...And I am an ardent reader of Victorian novels.Two stars for the excellent prose.Read George Gissing instead!',\n",

       " 'Krakauer\\'s book Under the Banner of Heaven has enough in it to disappoint everyone. It will disappoint, if not offend, Mormons and their sympathizers. It will also disappoint religious skeptics who long for substantial critiques of religious fundamentalism and the environments in which religious mania arises. If each of the book\\'s chapters were read as essays meant to stand on their own, each essay would provide a cogent analysis of some of the more interesting historical and contemporary accounts of the violence associated with Mormonism (and religion generally). The problem is the book was not written as a collection of loosely related essays but was written with the intent to weave a historical analysis from events in the recent past, all the way back to the mystical, if not fanciful, beginning of the Mormon religion.Krakauer starts by relating the story of two fundamentalist Mormons who murdered a young woman and her infant daughter because of some vaguely understood instruction on the part of God to do so. Krakauer alludes to, but does not explicitly reference, a version of Kant\\'s ontological fallacy: one can never disprove the claims of the murderers because they base their explanation, and admission, of their actions on divine instruction. In other words, Krakauer points out that you can\\'t refute the logic under which these murderers operated simply because they failed to operate under any logical system at all. Rather, they operated because \"it was the will of God\", to use the reductive and simplistic terms with which fundamentalists the world over justify their actions. In other words, to reduce an action to \"will of God\" is to absolve yourself of responsibility for that action; you state that God made you do it, and that there is no further discussion necessary. Therefore, Krakauer notes, the peculiar quality of fundamentalist religion is that it is impossible to critique in normal terms because fundamentalists are necessarily myopic in their perspective. God alone determines all things, they reason, so why consider another perspective? Thus we have a scene in which Krakauer interviews one of the murderers, and the murderer tells him in a blas&eacute; and banal manner that he did in fact commit murder and would do so again under similar circumstances.All of this points to the tension between the fundamentalist and the secular, modern world that Krakauer finds so poignant. But what of it? Where is the coherent narrative that connects these heinous murders to the origins of Mormonism? Krakauer would like to prove that the violent origins of Mormonism (which are very much tied up with the violent origins of the outlaw West of the 1800s) are somehow predictive of, and responsible for, the ultimate consequence: the murder of two innocent, defenseless people who did nothing worse than ignore the will of God. Krakauer certainly explains the lineage between modern-day Mormon fundamentalists and their ancestral polygamists. He certainly demonstratively proves the wanton abuse and manipulation of young girls and women at the hands of fundamentalist men in Mormonism, and notes quite correctly that this patriarchy is not exclusive to Mormons but rather rears its rapacious head in all fundamentalist religions, as well as some more mainstream ones.Krakauer\\'s fails to tie all of these points together. In general terms, Krakauer wants to prove that: (1) religious fundamentalism has its roots in mainstream religion, (2) religious fundamentalism is stultifying for those not in a position of authority, and (3) religious fundamentalism is based on an explicit rejection of any modern conception of the role of the state in regulating human affairs. Individually, Krakauer proves these points well. He demonstrates the lineage of Mormon fundamentalism to the original theological schism in Mormon dogma (which is the debate of polygamy and its legitimacy). He also demonstrates the venal and insidious way in which male authorities on fundamentalist communities humiliate, dictate, manipulate and destroy the lives of young girls and women. Finally, he demonstrates how incompatible fundamentalist thought is with the intellectual and political origins of the United States. In effect, Krakauer notes that fundamentalism and Jeffersonian-Lockean governments are ideologically opposed to one another. Since the role of the state is often in direct conflict with the will of God, Krakauer notes that many Mormon fundamentalists explicitly endorse defrauding the government and otherwise hewing to the lunatic fringe of the libertarian movement (not paying taxes, driving without license plates, etc.)Therefore, all of these ideas are explained well, in various chapters, and all of the chapters can stand alone as cogent analyses on problems at the intersection of fundamentalist religion and modern society. However, the narrative suffers because Krakauer does not quite pull all of these various themes together. The book jumps back and forth over the history of the Mormon Church and tries to relate current events to those of the recent past. While it is clear that the theological schism that afflicted the Mormon Church directly bears on the fact that there are polygamous Mormons living today, it does not explain the violence with which certain of these modern, polygamous people act. It is instructive to understand the violent origins of the world\\'s religions. It is interesting to draw parallels between historical and contemporary violence. It is tempting, further, to believe that the existence of these parallels proves a direct and necessary connection between historical occurrences and modern events. It is quite possible, even, that one can prove that the past necessarily predicts the present, but I don\\'t believe that Krakauer quite succeeded here.',\n",

       " \"Read this book and you can evaluate boats and surveyors. This in turn will make you feel more comfortable when you hire a surveyor to meet an insurance requirement or to evaluate things you don't feel competent to do yourself.This book does a great job explaining how glass is laid up, the different types of glass, mat, roving, etc, and where they should be used. Common problems found in fiberglass boats such as blistering are discussed with lots of surprising information.I've found that my personal experiences confirmed many of the points made by the author. Like the myth that fresh water boats are better than salt water. Contrasted with fresh water boats are more likely to have blister problems than saltwater.Today, many people come to me with questions about boats. As I write this review, I realize that many of the answers I give out come out of information I found in this book.I don't believe you have to have a survey on a boat to make an intelligent purchase decision. In part, because some of the surveyors are only interested in your money, and do not look boats over thoroughly. A properly educated individual can do most or all of his, or her, own survey.Some surveyors are very good, and some are very bad. How can you tell if someone is good or not?To become a surveyor some certifying organizations only require a couple of sample copies of surveys done and that you have a few books on your bookshelf. What a joke!I personally know of a real case, which happened in 1999, where an old survey was pulled up, the date changed and it was reused without any a new survey being actually done. This is a good reason to choose your own surveyor and not the one recommended by the seller.Going aloft and checking the rigging on a boat is not easy. Is it not surprising that important steps like these get skipped.Some surveyor's haven't read this book--so how good can they be? Contrast this with someone who has taken a 8 week course on surveying, holds a USCG license, and grew up on boats. This is the kind of person you want for a surveyor.It is up to you to be knowledgeable enough to make your own decisions-including choosing a surveyor if you feel you need one. This book will help you do that.Educate yourself. Being able to look a boat over to evaluate it for purchase is an important skill. This book is a good starting point. It is cheap insurance and worth the price.\",\n",

Not only do they repeatedly credit Satanism for beliefs completely unrelated to that Sect, but they mutilate any respectable definition of the peace sign -- calling it the \"Satanists Pentacle\" (when penta is the prefix meaning \"five\" and there are no five points inside a peace sign).Regarding the Wiccan Rede -- the authors erroneously attribute it to Aleister Crowley who had NOTHING to do with either Wicca or with the Rede, as an ethical principle that\\'s regularly drummed around many neo-pagan circles. Many would argue Crowley had nothing to do with ethics at all. In fact, he purported \"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole law\" (feel like having sex with your neighbor\\'s infant? Do it!) while the Wiccan Rede states \"An it harm none, do what ye will.\" The authors also falsely claim that Satanists follow the Rede, when they are not at all compelled by Wiccan dogma, but (according to the Satanist Bible) follow their own rules to do whatever\\'s the OPPOSITE of Christianity.The two examples, provided above, are but the tip of the iceberg for how inaccurate is this dictionary.

       " \"How to proceed with this one? When a bad book is written it is difficult to be convincing to anyone about its badness. It boils down to an opinions spitting war. Hopefully that will not happen here.If you are interested in the lives and eccentricities of polygamists, their bizarre behavior and their propensity to violence in defending their beliefs then this book will offer some enlightenment.I read the book specifically to find out more about Dan Lafferty and the murder of his sister-in-law and niece. I wanted to read the interviews that Krakauer had had with Lafferty and to get a better understanding as to how such heinous crimes could be perpetrated against members of the Lafferty family--Dan's own extended family-- in the name of religion. The book was informative from that standpoint.But if you think that this book will give you the supposed inside story of the dark side of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons) you are sadly mistaken.In the first place, none of the fundamentalists interviewed by Krakauer are members of the LDS Church. Since the late 1800's all individuals practicing polygamy and, more importantly, given to views and teachings that are inflammatory and contrary to those accepted by the LDS Church are summarily excommunicated. Moreover, Dan Lafferty--even in the Krakauer interviews--admits that he is not a member of the LDS Church and that his beliefs depart dramatically from anything the LDS Church teaches.In the second place, Krakauer's supposed research is riddled with references to the works of individuals like Fawn Brodie--an avowed nonobjective enemy of the LDS faith who wasted her life away writing unbelievable drivel about the Church's origins for decades. Mind you, she didn't stop with insubtantiable rubbish about Mormonism. She also wrote a landmark series of books about America's Founding Fathers that painted them as nothing more than a lecherous bunch of womanizers who just got lucky when it came to democracy. Brodie's reverse chauvinism is as transparent as water and the chip on her shoulder all too evident.If you are interested in historic facts regarding The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints read Leonard Arrington's excellent biography of Brigham Young, American Moses. It provides a fair narrative of many of the events included in Krakauer's book--information terribly twisted and misrepresented, I might add.If you want to read this book in order to look at radical religious fundamentalism, especially the tragic events centering on Dan Lafferty and his brother, Ron, then do so. But take Krakauer's supposed &quot;facts&quot; about The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-days Saints as what they are--nothing more than mean-spirited, small-minded hearsay.\",\n",

Mab, a fairy, introduces the element of fantasy, which inevitably leaves the reader hanging on to their seats grasping for more. With this fairy, Lia Block uses realism along with fantasy to create a familiar atmosphere. Her tremendous talent to bring out teen realism, makes the reader understand that the problems they are facing are the same all teens are going through. Lia Block can be considered a rebel for exploring the real issues of teens.Perhaps the greatest example of Lia Block\\'s talent is her use of fantasy in a dark world. She express a childhood activity of make-believe in a teenage life. \" Maybe Mab was real. Maybe she was the fury, the courage, the sex. Whatever Mab had been, now, joined with her tiny winged red-haired biscuit, Mab was the love, flying through night like an errant star that had longed to be know, even briefly, what made planet Earth\\'s children weep and sing.\" (Pg. 186, I Was A Teenage Fairy) It is through the fairy that the protagonist Barbie Marks can find herself and her true identity in the world. In her fantastic use of description, Lia Block brings the fantasy to life.Hence the fantasy mixed with realism is what gives the story character. Mab, the fantasy, and Barbie the realism, come together to help each other in their journeys of self- discovery and acceptance. \"Barbie was no longer afraid of anything. It was like that thing Mab had said about belief. The belief is sometimes the biggest part of it all.

But who are they anyway? What do they know? What makes them any more real? And now, Barbie realized , I am telling Mab to believe. I am telling Belief herself to believe.\" (Pg 179, I Was A Teenage Fairy) They bring out the truth in each other as they begin to understand, who they are is who they are. With this friendship, Lia Block captures the essence of childhood in a teenage world.Furthermore I Was A Teenage Fairy reflects the inner truth of issues all teens are forced to deal with. Parents, money, drugs, alcohol, and sex are clear in the life of a normal teen, however society has chose to ignore what is really going on in hopes that they aren\\'t present. Lia Block helps to clarify to all teens that the problems they are facing, are normal, and that it is ok to hold on to childhood imagination. She has become the light in an otherwise dark life in which some teens live in. They live in embarrassment and fear as the feel they are alone in the choices they make. Through this novel the reader is shown that the greatest asset of life is the uniqueness of your spirit and how each problem faced can be considered normal.',\n",

While I'll admit that the protagonist, Lewrie, is a homophobe, this is not out of character for him, as he has suffered from the perfidies of his half-sibling, who is gay, and at the time he seems shocked and disgusted by his apparently homosexual superior officer, he is still shy of his 20th birthday. I, on the other hand, liked the descriptions of life aboard ship; the strong battle scenes; the fact that Lewrie is not the perfect little hero; and the glimpses of British Colonial life in both America and the West Indies.

       " 'Not really the best Christian apologetic Lewis ever wrote: that would be his 1960 revision of _Miracles: A Preliminary Study_, in conjunction with his much earlier _The Problem of Pain_ (which should be read after MaPS).Still, MC is very accessible to many readers. The chapters of the first two sections were originally designed to be \"Broadcast Talks\" (the original title of the first publication of the first section) on BBC radio during WWII. They provide a colorful version (if somewhat oversimplified, as Lewis well knew) of the theistic Argument from Morality, which does help to introduce the principles within and around the argument; and, for section 2, a variation of what has come to be called the Lewis Trilemma (aka \\'Liar, Lunatic, or Lord?\\').The Trilemma is also oversimplified (keep in mind the broad target audience), and should not be considered to be Lewis\\' ultimate opinion on the subject; but unfortunately he never seems to have written a more technical version. (Some even more foreshortened versions can be found in other articles and essays he wrote.) In any event, although it is tempting to deride Lewis for simply presuming that the texts are sufficiently accurate to make such a judgment, any critic (pro or con) ought to know from other writings that Lewis was well aware of the benefits and limitations (and abuses) of textual criticism. Besides, the attempt to call into question the honesty of the textual authors/editors merely ends up reinstituting the Trilemma again at the next level. The Trilemma cannot easily be brushed aside: as the increasingly complex (and spurious) historical revisionism theories of the past 30 years (forms of which Lewis was already familiar with from his own day and prior) ironically testify.This doesn\\'t mean that the Trilemma argument is rock-solid, either, however. It isn\\'t a substitute for preliminary philosophical argument; nor is it a substitute for historical analysis. It perhaps works best as the very tail end of one (or ideally both) of those endeavors. Dr. Gregory Boyd makes much the same point very well in _Cynic Sage or Son of God_ (an indepth analysis of the logical bona fides of various historical propositions): if Jesus was like _that_, then we have a fairly straightforward explanation for why the earliest existant texts about him are like _this_--an explanation that doesn\\'t require (for instance) hypothesizing about what a hypothetical community did not believe based on what a hypothetical \\'early strata\\' of a hypothetical document hypothesized to have been used by this hypothetical community does _not_ say. |g| (As Boyd pithly observes: _that_ requires faith! Lewis, who had already seen numerous similar attempts at historical revisionism in his day, even outside Jesus-studies, would agree.)As always, careful qualification should be observed, pro or con: and it is admittedly worth noting, that due to certain restrictions in his delivery, Lewis is not as carefully qualified as he could be. (i.e., this is a necessarily truncated _introduction_ to the topic, not the final word on it.)The AfM in Section 1, remember, is also not rigorously proposed. (Although it is more thorough than the chapter on morality in MaPS, again for a good reason in relation to the structure of that greater work.) Unfortunately, again, Lewis never wrote a rigorous (specifically theistic) AfM--possibly because he believed that no total weight would hang adequately on it (there is some indication of this in how he uses it to make a restrained and subordinate point in MaPS). _The Abolition of Man_ (and a few essays here and there which presage it) does not exactly take up the slack as a theistic AfM--although, once again, this is because Lewis didn\\'t design it to. (See my review of TAoM.)The remaining two sections (also originally published separately) form the majority of the book. The 3rd section, on \\'Christian Morality\\', is again a useful and enjoyable (if very basic) introduction to the subject, both at a theological and historical level, in the sense of: \\'This is the consistency of the subject in relation to Christian philosophy, and this is (a very basic) overview of how Christian thinkers have tended to most cogently consider the matter.\\'The final section, on the doctrine of the Trinity, is the best popular introduction to the subject I know.Both last sections (3 and 4) can work well at helping readers, both believer and sceptic, to clear away some misconceptions concerning those two topics (the generally-Christian moral code, and the trinitarian doctrine). Unfortunately, theories on those topics are widespread and different enough, that confusion may result if these are taken to be _the_ foundational base of understanding for future reading; especially in the case of the Trinity.

Deep in Sherwood Forest, the legendary Robin Hood-the brave, good-humored outlaw- proves himself the best in England with his bow. Here are all the exciting tales of how Little John, Will Scarlet, Alan a Dale, and Friar Tuck joined his merry band of men...Robin Hood's breathtaking escapes from his arch enemy, the Sheriff of Nottingham...and one hilarious escapade after another, filled with quick action, scheming villains, and great surprises. Days of old bursting with pageantry, knights, and beautiful maidens return in a superb classic story.I also recommend the Story of King Arthur and his Knights by Howard Pyle. It's just as well written and illustrated.\",\n",
       " \"Hey you coniving READER FROM SOLACE!!!!!!!!!!!!You have just reuined the whole book for anyone who hasn't read it yet! Oh come on you do not tell everyone in your review what happened in this book! You are not a true Dragonlance fan if you didn't like this book. It was a bit boring at times but still it was very good. And for your info I did feel sad when she died and I bet you a lot of other people did to! So go back to where you came from and let the real people review this book! Now that that was done, In all truthfulness it was a great book. Not many people thought that any book that was about the 5th age was a good book, but this one and its predisesor broke that long line of duel books. This series will save the 5th age in my mind. Another thing, I think that MW and TH were right in explaining a lot about Krynns past. They needed to explain to the new readers all about that so no one would be confused. All in all again this was a great book.SO READ IT! ALL DRAGONLANCE FANS SHOULD READ IT!\",\n",

       " \"This is a great book supporting the idea that Christ died for all of humanity. Lightner argues relentlessly against the five-point Calvinist position that Christ died only for the elect, and exposes their twisted scriptural interpretations that words such as &quot;world&quot; and &quot;all&quot; mean the elect instead of what they plainly say. Lightner correctly notes that the scriptures &quot;shine&quot; with the concept of universality. He also notes, &quot;Those who would confine the love of God to the elect are guilty not only of arbitrarily restricting God's love but of placing limitations on the very nature of God.&quot; This book is highly recommended along with Did Christ Die Only for the Elect? by Norman F.

       " 'THE OUTSIDERSMain CharactersPony Curtis - the narrator and protagonist of the story. His elder brother, Darry, brings him up after the death of his parents in a car accident. Though Pony resents him, he is also in awe of him. He also idolizes his middle brother, Soda. All three brothers belong to a gang of poor teenagers called the Greasers, named for their long, oily hair. Their bitter rivals are the Socs, the rich kids living on the west side of town. Pony is involved in the murder of a Soc named Bob. After the killing, he runs away with his friend Johnny to Windrixville. There they hide in an abandoned church. When the church catches on fire, they bravely rescue some children trapped in it. Johnny is badly injured and has to be hospitalized. When he dies, Pony is completely shattered. He cannot reconcile himself to his friend\\'s death until he reads a letter Johnny has left for him telling him to \\'stay gold\\' and to continue appreciating sunsets. He finally understands that with hard work he can overcome his circumstances and not remain an outsider all his life. Pony then adopts a mission for himself to tell the rest of the world about the odds that under-privileged children have to face. He also realizes and appreciates how much Darry loves and cares for him.Johnny Cade - a member of the Greasers whom the other gang members try to protect. His father constantly beats him up, and his mother either ignores his presence or screams at him. He becomes a nervous wreck after he is terribly beaten up by the Socs. He starts carrying a switchblade in his pocket; when he and Pony are attacked by the Socs, he uses the knife to kill Bob in self-defense. He hides with Pony in an abandoned church in Windrixville and heroically rescues children who are trapped in the church after it catches fire. During the rescue, a burning beam falls on his back, and he later dies in a hospital. Before dying, he tells Dally that \\'fighting\\'s no good\\' and asks Pony to \\'stay gold.\\' Even after death, his spirit reaches out to Pony in the form of a letter which he leaves for him, exhorting him to remain pure and rise above being an outsider. The letter motivates Pony to tell the rest of the world that it is wrong to judge children by the amount of hair oil they wear.Dallas Winston (Dally) - the toughest, coldest, and meanest of the Greasers. He has been in and out of jail since the age of ten. He gives Pony and Johnny a gun and some money when they come to him after Bob\\'s death. He also tells them where to hide. During the rescue, Dally plunges into the burning church to rescue Johnny, who is trapped under a beam. Upset by Johnny\\'s death, he threatens the police with an unloaded gun after robbing a store. He dies without the world knowing about his qualities or the reasons for his delinquency.SETTINGThe Outsiders is set in a large, unnamed town in the United States. It is about a gang of teenage boys who are called the Greasers. They live on the east side of the town, also known as the wrong side of town; the eastside neighborhood is described in graphic detail. The story is set in the 1960\\'s and relates the incidents that take place over a few days. After killing Bob, Pony and Johnny take shelter in an abandoned church in Windrixville. After it catches fire and burns down, they return to their hometown, where Johnny dies in a hospital.CONFLICTProtagonistPony Curtis is the teenage narrator and protagonist of the novel. When his parents were killed in a car accident, Darry, his twenty- year-old brother, began to provide for him. He resents Darry\\'s bullying manner, not realizing that he does so because he loves him and wants him to make something of himself. Pony belongs to an eastside gang of poor teenagers, called the Greasers; their rivals are the Socs, the rich kids living on the west side of town.AntagonistPony\\'s antagonist is his status in life. Poor and from the wrong side of town, he gets no breaks in life, even though he is a good student and studies hard. He joins the Greasers because it is the thing to do if you live on the east side of town. Their rivals are the Socs, a gang of rich, spoiled kids living on the west side of town. The Socs constantly pick fights with the Greasers, and Bob, one of the Socs, attacks Johnny and Pony because they have been friendly with Cherry. Johnny kills Bob in self-defense, and he and Pony go into hiding in a church in Windrixville. When the church catches on fire, Johnny and Pony try to save the children trapped inside. Johnny is serious injured during the rescue and dies a few days later in a hospital. Dally, who was Johnny\\'s best friend, is completely shattered by his death. Crazy with grief, he robs a store and then threatens the police with an unloaded gun. As a result, he is killed. Now Pony has lost two friends. He falls sick, becomes delirious, tries to deny Johnny\\'s death, and begins to fail in school.ClimaxThe climax occurs when Pony reads the letter that Johnny has written to him before his death. Johnny encourages his friend to \"stay gold\" - to look for the sunsets and good things in life. He tells Pony that if he tries, he will be able to make something worthwhile out of his life. Reading the letter is the turning point in Pony\\'s life.OutcomeThe novel ends as a tragic comedy. Even though Bob, Johnny, and Dally have needlessly perished, Pony overcomes his problems, largely due to Johnny\\'s letter of encouragement. He reconciles with Darry, finally understanding how much his older brother loves and cares for him. He also accepts that he does not have to be an outsider or a Greaser for the rest of his life. In order to seek help and understanding for underprivileged children like himself, Pony\\'s mission becomes to tell others about the immense obstacles that stand in the way of success for teenagers from the wrong side of town. The novel, therefore, ends on a note of hope and optimism.PLOTPony Curtis is a member of the Greasers, a gang of poor teenagers with long, oily hair and from the wrong side of town. While returning home from the movies one night, Pony is attacked by the Socs, a gang of rich kids from the west side of town. Pony is afraid that they are going to kill him and starts shouting for help. His brothers (Darry and Soda), along with Steve Randle, Two Bit Matthews, Dally Winston, and Johnny Cade, rush to his rescue. After ascertaining that Pony is relatively unharmed, Darry shouts at him for walking alone and tells him that he should use a bit of common sense. Darry is Pony\\'s oldest brother who has provided for him since his parents were killed in a car accident. Darry knows that Pony is smart and wants him to do well in life. As a result, he constantly nags Pony about doing well in school and making good grades. Pony resents his brother\\'s intrusion in his life and his unemotional ways. In contrast, Pony adores Soda, his middle brother. He is a high school dropout, who works at a gas station with his best friend Steve Randal. Two-Bit Matthews is a member of the Greasers who always tries to have the last word on things. Johnny Cade is another gang member whom everyone tries to protect, because his father constantly tries to beat him up. The toughest character of the Greaser\\'s gang is Dally, who has been in and out of jail since the age of ten. Pony, Johnny, and Dally decide to go to the drive-in the next evening. There they meet Cherry and Marcia, friends of the Socs. Dally is rude and obnoxious. When Cherry throws a coke in his face, he stalks off in anger. Pony and Johnny are left to watch the movie with the girls, but they are soon joined by Two Bits. After the movie they decide to walk to Two Bits\\' house to pick up his car in order to take the girls home. Along the way, Pony and Cherry find that they have a lot in common; they are both are idealistic dreamers, who love sunsets. Suddenly a blue Mustang pulls up near them. Two members of the Socs, Bob and Randy, emerge from the car to confront them. A fight almost takes place between the boys, but Cherry prevents it by getting into the Mustang.Two-Bit goes off to play snooker, and Pony and Johnny go to the vacant lot where they often hang out. At about two-thirty in the morning, Pony gets up with a start, for he has fallen asleep in the vacant lot. He rushes home to find Darry awake and frantic with worry. He shouts at Pony, which results in an argument. When Darry slaps his younger brother, Pony rushes out of the house and finds Johnny. As they walk in the park, Bob, Randy, and several other Socs attack them for being with their girls earlier. In the fight that follows, Johnny, in self-defense, kills Bob with his switchblade.In a panic, Johnny and Pony go to Dally for help. He gives them a loaded gun, money, and directions to reach an abandoned church in Windrixville, where they can hide out. They change their appearance by cutting off their long hair and pass the time by reading Gone with the Wind and discussing life. Once Pony recites one of Robert Frost\\'s poems, \"Nothing Gold Can Stay.\" Johnny understands that \"gold\" in the poem stands for freshness, innocence, and purity.On the fifth day of their hiding, Dally comes to visit Pony and Johnny. He takes them out to eat and informs them that the tension between the Socs and the Greasers has increased. A rumble between the two gangs is supposedly to take place the following evening. Dally says that he has started carrying an unloaded gun to serve as a deterrent to any serious trouble. Johnny announces his decision to turn himself in to the police, for he does not want to be on the run for the rest of his life. He believes that he will get a light sentence since he has killed Bob in self-defense. Dally tries to dissuade him; he knows first-hand that any prison time is miserable.THEMESMajorThe major theme of the novel revolves around the purposelessness of any gang of teenagers. The book centers on the foolish gang rivalry existing between the Socs, the rich kids from the west side of town, and the Greasers, the poor kids from the east side.Pony, the protagonist of the story, is bitter about the fact that the wealthy Socs have nice cars, fancy clothes, and girlfriends; things are simply easier for them than for the Greasers. Because the Socs are convinced that they are better, they constantly pick on members of the Greasers, who fight back. During one squabble, Bob, one of the Socs, is murdered by Johnny in self-defense. Then Johnny, while hiding out in a church, is killed while trying to rescue children from the burning building. In reaction to Johnny\\'s death, Dally, his best friend, goes on a rampage. He robs a store and points an unloaded gun at the police; as a result, he is shot and killed. Because of the needless gang fighting, three teenagers are killed in the novel, clearly pointing out the negative aspect of belonging to a gang. Hinton is obviously trying to warn the reader against participation in any gang.MinorRelated to the major theme of the book is the theme that a teenager can rise above his circumstances through hard work, patience, and determination. Pony is the proof of this theme. Even though he is born into poverty, loses his parents in a car accident at an early age, and participates in the Greasers, by the end of the book, he is determined to better his plight in life, largely due to the encouragement he receives from the deceased Johnny in a letter. At the close of the novel, Pony wants to tell the world that underprivileged children need to have some breaks in order to get ahead and need to be judged for who they are, not by how they look or how they dress. Hinton definitely convinces the reader that Pony, because of his intelligence and determination, will rise above the poverty and gang life that he was born into.MOODWhen the story opens, the mood is bitter and rebellious. Pony and the other Greasers resent the fact that the Socs have lots of money, nice cars, fancy clothes, and many girlfriends. In contrast, they are poor and must work extremely hard for everything they have. In addition, society is prejudiced against them because of their clothes, long hair, and greasy appearance. In the middle of the novel, the mood becomes increasingly angry. The Greasers are tired of the Socs always picking on them, and the Socs are furious about the Greasers hanging out with some of \"their girls.\" As a result, the Socs jump Pony and Johnny. In self-defense Johnny kills Bob, one of the Socs. The mood then becomes one of terror. Pony and Johnny are scared for their own safety and fear the police. Upon Dally\\'s advice, they hide in an abandoned church and worry about being found. The mood then switches to great sadness, for Johnny, in trying to rescue the children when the church catches on fire, is killed himself. Dally then gets himself foolishly shot by the police, leaving Pony with two less friends. By the end of the novel, however, the mood has some degree of hope. Pony is determined to rise above his past. He adopts a new mission in life, to tell the world about the problems and deprivations of underprivileged children, like himself. It is obvious that in the end, Hinton is very sympathetic towards the plight of Pony and the Greasers.',\n",
       " \"Accurately portrayed teen angst is the key to R&J;, and Shakespeare knocked it out of the park with this one. If one reads this play closely they will find the gorgeous poetry and subtle humor and vulgarity pleasing, but what is more pleasing to the mature reader is the acute portrayal of teens who think they are in love. This must have been the go to teen reference of its day. There is locker room talk between Romeo and his buddies, especially Mercutio. (Mercutio is one of Shakespeare's dirtiest characters, and one of his wittiest.) There is the horny teenager who flits from lust to lust with no thought of consequences, and there is the young girl who makes a serious attempt at very adult decisions. It is all there, and what is more the supporting cast of this play boasts some real genius of character. Lord Capulet is a ferocious father, who has a powerful temper and spirit, and Friar Laurence is one of Shakespeare's most ambiguously motivated characters.One can read this play on the surface level and certainly enjoy it. I think most readers do just that. As do most of the productions I have seen. But there is a dark undercurrent to this play that will ring true with anyone who has ever dealt with that most powerful of emotions. Love.Like Shakespeare's best, R&J; will continue to yield new discoveries on each reading. As we mature in our lives, so does our understanding and appreciation of this play.\",\n",

We also saw Needles, another Kentucky Derby winner who was standing at Calumet at the time, and I'm surprised no mention was made of him.The same day, we visited Leslie Comb ll's Spendthrift Farm that actually went belly up before Calumet, but not that long before.There, we saw Nashua, Swaps, Creme dela Creme, Sword Dancer, and Gallant Man.

       " \"This novel -- astonishing in its power, being Carson McCuller's first -- has justly come to be considered to be a classic of modern American literature. McCullers' creative prowess is breathtaking -- she has brought to life the 1930s American South, in a non-judgemental, gently-written yet cinematically focused style of prose that has few equals. Her characters spring to life with all of their beauty and warts intact, all of their despair and hope, all of their love and hate, all of their joy and pain and anger. The prejudice that existed (and, unfortunately, still exists in many places and hearts) -- against blacks, the poor, the uneducated, the politically radical -- is laid out before the reader in such a way as to allow us to make up our own minds about it.Each of the characters in this wonderful novel seems to inhabit their own private pocket of loneliness. There are those who dare to hope and dream -- chief among them the unforgettable Mick Kelly -- and they keep a tight rein on these hopes. McCullers brings this point home well on p. 199: '...by habit they shortened their thoughts so that they would not wander out into the darkness beyond tomorrow.'The story evolves into a languidly expanding, yet unstoppable diaspora of desperate, lonely people -- all of whom seem to have at least part of their hopes for life focused on Singer, the mute who is at the center of this work. The musical metaphors McCullers employs in Mick's life are brilliant in themselves -- but there are many brilliant things about this work, it is filled with them.McCullers is a great example of a talented artist whose life was much too short -- but she has left us with an astounding body of work of the highest quality.\",\n",

       " \"I read the book jacket and was intrigued by the premise--a Jewish Chinese American girl. That alone stirs up many thought-provoking issues, like how an Asian American girl attempts to find her identity, or the similarities between Jewish and Asian Americans. That alone would have been enough. The problem is that Jen adds a lot more to her plot. A little too much maybe. On top of the Asian American issues, you've got your 70's zeitgeist, black American issues, hippies living in teepees, and generation gaps. It almost seems like Jen is making a bold attempt to create the Great American Novel--encompassing each and every ingredient of the Salad Bowl, aka America. But the book is so all-encompassing that Jen hardly gets truly in-depth into anything. The Jewish Asian girl premise is lost within the first fifty pages, and maintained periodically by half-heartedly throwing in a few Yiddish phrases through the rest of the novel. Because of it's broadness, this book does not bring up as many Asian American issues as one would hope. It's a worthy competitor for the Great American Novel title, but unfortunately, Jen isn't much of an established writer outside of the Asian American literture realm for her book to be considered for the GAN pool.\",\n",

       " \"In an earlier review that scrolled off the page long ago, I suggested that this was Rand's best book because (a) she stuck largely to political theory and (b) had enough sense to get help with the hard parts. You can click to the next page if you want to read the rest of the review.Here I'll add that it's an important book for another reason: between the lines, it makes a tremendous concession to non-Objectivist ethics.In the opening essay, on p. 24 of the current paperback edition, Rand acknowledges that there is such a thing as &quot;socially objective value&quot; -- her term for what Mises would have called _subjective_ value -- and says it is this kind of value that the free market serves.In the course of discussing this sort of value, Rand concedes (with her teeth gritted) that the values appropriate for what she called &quot;man _qua_ man_&quot; (and here defines as &quot;man at his best&quot;) just aren't appropriate for everybody.If this insight were followed up consistently, the whole Objectivist ethic would need to be revised from the ground up.

       " 'C.S. Lewis was a rare individual. One of the few non-clerics to be recognised as a theologian by the Anglican church, he put forth the case for Christianity in general in ways that many Christians beyond the Anglican world can accept, and a clear description for non-Christians of what Christian faith and practice should be. Indeed, Lewis says in his introduction that this text (or indeed, hardly any other he produced) will help in deciding between Christian denominations. While he describes himself as a \\'very ordinary layman\\' in the Church of England, he looks to the broader picture of Christianity, particularly for those who have little or no background. The discussion of division points rarely wins a convert, Lewis observed, and so he leaves the issues of ecclesiology and high theology differences to \\'experts\\'. Lewis is of course selling himself short in this regard, but it helps to reinforce his point.This collection contains several of C.S. Lewis\\' classic works (although it is not in fact a complete collection of all his writings, not even of all his non-fiction writings). It contains the following works: \\'Mere Christianity\\', \\'The Screwtape Letters\\', \\'The Great Divorce\\', \\'The Problem of Pain\\', \\'Miracles\\', \\'A Grief Observed\\', plus \\'The Abolition of Man\\'. It does provide an excellent survey of Lewis\\' theology, ethics, and general outlook on life. I will highlight two of the selections that show the different ways Lewis approaches things.For the first example, the book \\'Mere Christianity\\' looks at beliefs, both from a \\'natural\\' standpoint as well as a scripture/tradition/reason standpoint. Lewis looks both at belief and unbelief - for example, he states that Christians do not have to see other religions of the world as thoroughly wrong; on the other hand, to be an atheist requires (in Lewis\\' estimation) that one view religions, all religions, as founded on a mistake. Lewis probably surprised his listeners by starting a statement, \\'When I was an atheist...\\' Lewis is a late-comer to Christianity (most Anglicans in England were cradle-Anglicans). Thus Lewis can speak with the authority of one having deliberately chosen and found Christianity, rather than one who by accident of birth never knew any other (although the case can be made that Lewis was certainly raised in a culture dominated by Christendom).Lewis also looks at practice - here we are not talking about liturgical niceties or even general church-y practices, but rather the broad strokes of Christian practice - issues of morality, forgiveness, charity, hope and faith. Faith actually has two chapters - one in the more common use of system of belief, but the other in a more subtle, spiritual way. Lewis states in the second chapter that should readers get lost, they should just skip the chapter - while many parts of Christianity will be accessible and intelligible to non-Christians, some things cannot be understood from the outside. This is the `leave it to God\\' sense of faith, that is in many ways more of a gift or grace from God than a skill to be developed.Finally, Lewis looks at personality, not just in the sense of our individual personality, but our status as persons and of God\\'s own personality. Lewis\\' conclusion that there is no true personality apart from God\\'s is somewhat disquieting; Lewis contrasts Christianity with itself in saying that it is both easy and hard at the same time. Lewis looks for the `new man\\' to be a creature in complete submission and abandonment to God. This is a turn both easy and difficult.\\'Mere Christianity\\' was originally a series of radio talks, published as three separate books - \\'The Case for Christianity\\', \\'Christian Behaviour\\', and \\'Beyond Personality\\'. This book brings together all three texts. Lewis\\' style is witty and engaging, the kind of writing that indeed lives to be read aloud. Lewis debates whether or not it was a good idea to leave the oral-language aspects in the written text (given that the tools for emphasis in written language are different); I think the correct choice was made.On the other hand, Lewis can write in ways that are intensely personal and reflective. This is true of the book \\'A Grief Observed\\'. This was drawn out of his personal experience with his wife, Joy. C.S. Lewis was a confirmed bachelor (not that he was a \\'confirmed bachelor\\', mind you, just that he had become set enough in his ways over time that he no longer held out the prospect of marriage or relationships). Then, into his comfortable existence, a special woman, Joy Davidson, arrived. They fell in love quickly, and had a brief marriage of only a few years, when Joy died of cancer.This left Lewis inconsolable.For his mother had also died of cancer, when he was very young.Cancer, cancer, cancer!Lewis goes through a dramatic period of grief, from which he never truly recovers (according to the essayist Chad Walsh, who writes a postscript to Lewis\\' book). He died a few years later, the same day as the assassination of John F. Kennedy.However, Lewis takes the wonderful and dramatic step of writing down his grief to share with others. The fits and starts, the anger, the reconciliation, the pain--all is laid bare for the reader to experience. So high a cost for insight is what true spirituality requires. An awful, awe-ful cost and experience.\\'Did you know, dear, how much you took away with you when you left? You have stripped me even of my past...\\'All that was good paled in comparison to the loss. How can anything be good again? This is such an honest human feeling, that even the past is no longer what is was in relation to the new reality of being alone again.In the end, Lewis reaches a bit of a reconciliation with his feelings, and with God.\\'How wicked it would be, if we could, to call the dead back. She said not to me, but to the chaplain, \"I am at peace with God.\" \\'Lewis had a comfortable, routine life that was jolted by love, and then devasted by loss. Through all of this, he took pains to recount what he was going through, that it might not be lost, that it might benefit others, that there might be some small part of his love for Joy that would last forever.I hope it shall.This is a wonderful collection.',\n",

Ely has delivered a fascinating show business yarn with absorbing insight into human nature, sometimes noble, often naive, and occasionally downright repugnant.

       " 'This was a wonderful book; one that I needed to read given my questions concerning God and His role in our lives. I also needed to read this book to determine how it is that the Church continues to spread the word of God given that the Church is organized and run by man. Man, inherently, because of the fall of Adam, is prone to sin. So how is it that the Church, run by man, who is prone to sin, can be the one organization to espouse the \"truth\" of God and His Son, Jesus?The first aspect of this book that I really enjoyed was that Father Sheed takes some very complicated topics and puts them into plain English so that the lay person can understand them. Father Sheed\\'s explanation of the trinity, one of the most complicated aspects of the Catholic Religion (in my opinion), was explained in a most wonderful way. It was explained so that I could understand it and without all the \"religious\" terminology that usually accompanies such explanations.The second aspect of the book that I enjoyed was the organization. He takes these issues from step one and then logically continues with the book up to the end. He takes the prior steps and incorporates them into later steps and wonderfully demonstrates how they all fit together.The third aspect of this book I loved was the explanation of why Jesus \"lowered\" himself to human form. Father Sheed had a wonderful way of explaining why is it was that Jesus came to do what he did. He ties this in with the fall of Adam and how the fall of Adam severed our relationship with God. Father Sheed also explains what \"original sin\" is and why we have it. It is not that the person born has sinned but has the sin of Adam just because we are human. Because of the fall, man was severed with God but Jesus came to \"bridge\" that gap and that is what he did.Do not get the idea that the \"sanity\" part of the book title means that if you don\\'t live the Catholic Way perfectly that one is insane. This is not what that term means in the context of the book. Sanity means seeing the world as it really is; not deceiving ourselves that the world is differnt that it really is. If we can do that, then we are seeing things correctly and have \"sanity\". However, not seeing the world and God as they truly are does not mean you are insane, in the mental aspect of the word. Father Sheed gives us a good idea what it means to not see things as they really are and how to change that in our lives.This is a wonderful book. However, this did take me a long time to read. Father Sheed has much to say and it is all something that you must think about to fully understand what he is saying. You cannot read this book like a fiction novel; you can\\'t or you will miss much of what Fr. Sheed is saying. It will take time but the time is well worth it.I have already purchased two more of Fr. Sheed\\'s books and I look forward to reading them.If you have an interest in learning more about the Catholic, or even just the Christian faith in plain English, then I cannot recommend this book highly enough. It certainly has helped me along in my own search on God and the role He plays in our lives.Enjoy!',\n",

       " \"In this book, Michelle Mitchell clears up one of the biggest misconceptions about the 18-35 year old crowd. Too often they are written off as self-indulgent, tuned out brats. Mitchell makes the compelling case that what is often perceived as cynicism is really just healthy skepticism.After all, this is a generation that has been marketed to and spun for their entire lives. No wonder they want to know the facts and judge for themselves.She also makes a stong case that what this generation needs more than anything else from their political leaders is authenticity. They want someone who will tell them the truth, even if it is unpleasant and then lay out a compelling vision as to how to approach the problem, an approach that includes a role for them. Until such a person comes along, this generation will be perfectly content to satisfy their political urges in local direct action and forego much activity on the national political scene.If what you do isn't going to make a difference, then why bother playing that game? Why not play a game that show immediate results, seems to be the attitude.All in all, this is an enjoyable read that is filled with insight for anyone who hopes to reach this increasingly important demographic block of voters.\",\n",

       " \"The book that I read was called Skeleton Key Anthony Horowitz. This book is about a boy named Alex Rider who is a spy for an agency in England called M16. He has already saved the world twice before his 15th birthday. This time Alex was sent to spy on an old Russian general named Sarov. Enough uranium to create a nuclear bomb that would destroy an entire country was recently purchased by Sarov. Alex went to spy on him and got captured. Sarov's plan was to detonate the bomb by four old submarines that hold 1/5 of the world's uranium supply. This would then cause about triple the amount of damage. After the bomb detonated, Sarov would bring Russia back to the old days when it was a war country and had much power in the world. Alex had to stop this from happening at all costs. Alex defuses the bomb and saves the world for the third time. He then heads off to visit his friend in the South of F France.I recommend this book to almost anyone. The people that would especially love this book would be the people that love adventure and high action books. This book is so thrilling you could literally fall off the edge of your seat by the intensity.\",\n",

       " \"Though Wuthering Heights was well-written and captivating, the plot line left a bit to be desired. The love, lust, revenge, and hatred all added up to a story resembling a soap opera. While the novel did present a powerful love story, it was one that fueled manipulative plots of revenge. Even so, the book was enjoyable. But eventually, the positive aspects of the novel were overshadowed and it became difficult to continue reading because of the layered plot. Bronte was a great writer, but her characters were merely two-dimensional entities whose goals in life were the direct result of love or hate. The story seemed somewhat unrealistic, simply because the characters seemed to represent extremes. So, while Wuthering Heights was very well-written, it didn't keep my interest. So I give it a rating a little above average.\",\n",

       " \"I found this novel extremely thought provoking. It is a book every young and old American should read to learn what could easily happen to their civilization or rather what is happening. George Orwell is acting as a visionary in telling a story that is becoming reality more each day. It is frightening to think if the government in our society is not stopped they can become equally as corrupt as the Party in Oceania. The thought that the government not only controls what you are doing each day, but also controls how you think is terrifying.The brilliant novel kicks off with Winston Smith, a member of the Party, climbing up flights of stairs with his throbbing varicose ulcer aching. The thirty-nine year old goes through his life second guessing the Party and all it stands for. Winston starts by recording his thoughts in a diary. After reviewing his thoughts he even wondered if he himself was indeed a lunatic. Through the book he is running from the dreaded Thought Police. Winston became involved with Julia another enemy of Big Brother. They met up secretly in multiple hiding spots. There they exchanged words about their combined hatred for the Party which followed with romantic pleasantries between the two. Inevitably the two are captured and brought to the Ministry of Love where their minds were molded into the stupid followers of the Party. At the conclusion Winston gives his soul up to the Party.This is a must read for all individuals. Even though written as a fiction novel the story 1984, can be linked to parts of today's society despite the fact that the year itself has since passed. The way the novel is able to draw in readers and immediately involve them in what events are occurring in the novel, is simply mind boggling. I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a sense of excitement for the book they are reading.\",\n",

       " 'Random House, calling on English Professors and other literary professionals, declared James Joyce\\'s Ulysses as the greatest novel of the 20th Century.Who am I to disagree?While I may not have too many initials following my name, I\\'d like to believe that my opinion about Ulysses is valid in its own right. After all, I have taken the trouble to read the thing. Also, I have a bachelor\\'s degree, and have taught High School English. I\\'ve also read an exegesis of Ulysses, and am currently reading Finnegans Wake, so I do have something in the way of qualifications. At heart, I account my opposing opinion to the fact that I believe that the standards that I use to judge the merits of a novel are different than those employed by the fellows at Random House. Further, I think that my criteria aren\\'t necessarily all that bad.Indeed, I like to believe that my criteria are probably closer to what most people look for in a novel.The things that I look for in a novel include: an exciting plot; memorable, interesting characters; clean, crisp writing.The things that I believe the Random House voters look for in a novel include: intricate word play; obscure literary allusion/allegory; originality in form and syntax, even to the point of obfuscation.Ulysses certainly is a winner in the second category, as all eight hundred pages of it concern one man on one day in his life. Most of those pages are devoted to word play, literary allusions, experiments in literary form, etc. What Ulysses does not spend a lot of time on, however, is developing plot and character--the things I love in a good book. There is almost no clean, crisp writing to be found--Joyce\\'s primary consideration was not to be understood; he wanted to be *clever*.For instance, take the \"word overture.\" At the beginning of the \"Siren section,\" (Ulysses is modeled after The Odyssey), Joyce mirrors the overture of a musical by running together out-of-context fragments and snatches of words from the chapter to come. He does this without preamble or explanation and reading it is a very confusing experience. But Joyce didn\\'t write it with the intention of being clear--he had something artistic to say, or something experimental to try, or something like that. Please understand that this makes Joyce very, very different from most of the masters who preceeded him, such as Thomas Hardy, Leo Tolstoy, Charles Dickens, Victor Hugo, etc. They wrote in an effort to communicate themselves very clearly; Joyce wants to be difficult. They wanted to write interesting stories, Joyce wants something altogether different.For myself, I neither like Joyce\\'s style nor his intentions. I honestly cannot figure out the point, other than cleverness for cleverness\\' sake. Further, I believe that his method, which has become the main literary aesthetic in schools (which is why they all concentrate so much on literary devices such as metaphor and allegory), has been detrimental to education. By turning literature from entertaining stories into puzzle solving, I believe he has turned many children away from reading. I think this helps to account for, say, J.K. Rowling\\'s success. It\\'s not that kids don\\'t like to read, it\\'s that they don\\'t like to read things like Ulysses or similar efforts by Joyce\\'s admirers.Many people reading this will likely disagree with me. They think that Joyce was a \"genius.\" That\\'s fine--they\\'re entitled to their opinions. But, I\\'m entitled to mine as well, and, in my opinion, Ulysses does not say nearly enough of importance to be worth all the trouble it is to decode, and in the end it is simply not a lot of fun. In my opinion, there are tons of other books that have just as much of value (if not more), and *also* have exciting plots, interesting characters and clear writing. Joyce was, perhaps, a genius at puzzle-writing and encoding, but Ulysses is a poor novel.',\n",

There is also a great introduction to basic Near East culture and history, as well as an interesting appendix on the creation of an ancient Babylonian translation.

The story starts with a celebration of Samantha's birthday... a celebration that lasts more than a week. The story ends with an exploration of how they came to be together in this lifetime and others, and how their souls are eternally connected.Although the characters are great, the writing is a little on the boring side. This is mostly because the women spend a lot of time touring Sedona and shopping. The book is very heavy on spoken conversation (as contrasted with the implied, internal conversation characters tend to have in most successful books). Most of the conversation is the mushy, almost sickeningly-sweet dialogue one would expect from a newly in-love couple, but they follow through to the bedroom often. In short, there is not really a point to this book. It follows their `honeymoon' period in almost too much detail.That said, it's still an enjoyable book with likable characters. Just don't expect too much excitement, tension or angst. I've read it twice and enjoyed it both times.It's a true feel-good story.\",\n",

He tells us about his life in New Orleans with his maker, Lestat, who is a selfish and sometimes nasty vampire, and Claudia, their vampire child.Unlike Lestat, Louis loathes taking human lives, but he must do it to survive; Lestat often gets irritated because of this. Sometimes the two argued so much, it was hard to believe they were actually able to live with each other.The book takes us through many adventures, and some surprising twists and turns. I liked the dark feel of it; it was the kind of book I liked to read sitting by a window on a rainy day. I also liked how different the vampires were than most vampires in other novels I've read. It showed them as much more human than the typical vampire, and they weren't as evil as most would think.I would have to say that so far, &quot;Interview With the Vampire&quot; is my favorite Vampire Chronicle.\",\n",

       " 'This book is primarily about relationships and how sexuality applies but specifically what Giddens terms a \"pure relationship\". This type of relationship exists between two individuals irregardless of gender. Characteristics of this relationship will parallel those of a democracy in that both individuals will have rights and duties but will be equal. Relationships will become a contract between two individuals emphasizing a confluent love rather than one that is dominated by economic and political controlling behaviors resulting in gender inequality associated with relationships within the realm of marriage. Pure relationships will be formed with set parameters according to each individual\\'s needs and desires. Additionally it will not be a relationship \"until death do us part\" but rather one that states \"until we no longer agree to be\". Sex will be one aspect of this relationship that can be negotiated as a rite but not as a duty and will be completely separate to that of the relationship. It will no longer be considered a right of the husband but a means for each individual to acquire pleasure.Hedonism will be widely accepted in the future according to Giddens. In fact he expects Hedonistic Consumerism to replace capitalistic productivity as the driving force behind economics and politics. The consumerism of sex is proof to this phenomenon. During the industrial age one had to work long and hard to be productive while sexual pleasures were considered detrimental to those efforts. The additional disposable time one has earned through an incredible increase in production via the informational age has reversed this view that sexual pleasure is counterproductive. A sexual transformation is at hand.Giddens discusses Freud in detail concerning the phallus and penis envy. He is somewhat critical of Freud but applies these concepts to explain how and why man and woman develop their sexual identity and how this identity explains society. Men develop a masculine identity while women femininity. It is this masculinity that has plagued man for it is a lacking identity. It lacks intimacy and so it desires what it lacks. Women have intimacy but lack independence and autonomy. At some point in modernity women have emerged from their role of mother to join society as an equal of man. This has led to a subconscious effort by man to control women. Man sees this emergence as a threat and as a result responds at times with violence. Rape is the modern context is an act of control or punishment. Rape in pre-modern times usually occurred in the fringes of society such as the frontiers lacking authority, during wars by soldiers, etc. but not as punishment or controlling measure but for the sheer act of sexual pleasure. Rape, according to Giddens, in today\\'s society is committed by loyalists of a day gone by where men ruled the roost. It is their way of being deviant.I think if Giddens is correct we will witness a future in which one will not be viewed as a \"manly man\" or a \"girly girl\" but as an individual without any gender specific roles to portray. This reminds me of Foucault\\'s view on Greek sexuality. The Greeks did not see beauty in the form of a woman or a man but rather saw beauty in a being irregardless of their gender. Bi-sexuality or homosexuality did not exist for they did not recognize the distinction. Giddens celebrates the lifestyles that are emerging in today\\'s world. These lifestyles are in fact not only emerging but are thriving so I would have a hard time disputing his conclusions that sexual emancipation is at hand. One only has to visit any urban city of significant population to witness first-hand the numerous gay bars and nightclubs, swinger\\'s clubs, and BDSM clubs that have opened in recent years. While I gained some insight into what is happening in society concerning sexuality, I am unsure if I should be confused or concerned.',\n",

While joining the group late he manages to paint fair portrait of the early years through interveiws and a few remaining written records of the time, namley Asimov's journal and their communal house newsletters. The reader can draw his own conclusions about the group in-fighting and personality clashes. As a whole it is a fascinating story of the avant garde culture of the late '30s and early '40s. Its one weakness is that Knight jumps around chronologically, often jumping forward or backward several years during the recounting of a single incident. It is also difficult to determine who is recounting the story; sometimes there are first person accounts from Knight, a quote from someone during an interview years later, or a retelling of an event by an eye witness other than Knight.

       " 'This is the second Raymond Chandler novel I have read after \"The Long Goodbye\". I rarely ever read fiction but I can not overemphasize how much I enjoy reading Chandler\\'s novels. These stories are most definitely NOT \"page turners\" and I mean that as a compliment. A \"page turner\" leaves the reader in suspense about what is going to happen or what is going to be revealed, often leading me, at least, to superficially scanning much of the prose in order to move ahead more quickly. There is some of this suspense in \"Farewell My Lovely\" (actually more than in \"Goodbye\" which spends more time philosophizing) but it is in taking every sentence as it comes, rolling it around in your mouth and savoring the flavor that gives the real pleasure in these novels.What particularly stands out in this story is the shades of gray of everything. Whereas many detective stories try to fit all the pieces together at the end and show us good guys and bad guys, Chandler\\'s protoganist PI Philip Marlowe sees the world in shades of gray. He doesn\\'t attempt to get to the bottom of people\\'s motivations, and that includes himself. At the beginning of the story, he sees a big white man enter a black nightclub and then sees a black man come flying out the door. For no apparent reason, and admitting that it was none of his business, Marlowe goes in to see what is happening and gets drawn into the mystery. We see people commit murders and yet Marlowe feels that they are not \"all bad\". Marlowe encounters some policemen who are good, some who are bad and some who are in the middle. In the end, Marlowe figures out more or less what happened, but admits there are holes in his theory, and he can\\'t completely explain why the characters he encountered acted the way they did. This is the way the real world operates and Chandler/Marlowe is telling us to be honest with ourselves and to admit that we often don\\'t know why we do the things we do and whether we are being really consistent.I find it interesting to note that although this story was written almost 70 years ago, it shows a world that is pretty indistinguishable to our own. The story does not seem \"dated\". We see the materialist Los Angeles society that I grew up in during the 1960\\'s and 1970\\'s, and the type of people who live on its fringes. The only jarring note I encountered showing the changes in technology since 1940 was when Marlowe mentions he saw an \"ice truck\" parked on the street. Well, I guess time does move on.In closing, this novel has one of the most famous Chandler-quotations of them all: \"I needed a drink, I needed a lot of life insurance, I needed a vacation, I needed a home in the country. What I had was a coat, a hat, and a gun.\"',\n",

       " 'Let me begin by stating most emphatically that based on what I know of the late Ms. Fallaci\\'s reputation as a journalist and public speaker she had more courage under one of her little fingernails than legions of other writers will ever have in their entire cringing selves. I\\'ll pile on by also stating that I largely agree with her views -- strident though they certainly are -- on many subjects, including the nominal subjects of this book: radical Islam and its infiltration of Europe. And Ms. Fallaci was nothing if not passionate and entirely devoted to warning the slumbering guardians of Western Civilization of their possible demise -- not to mention their complicity in the same.With that neatly out of the way, I can say without reservation that I found `The Force of Reason\\' badly wanting. Reading page after passionate page of this tome reminded me of Emperor Joseph\\'s admonishment to the giddy Wolfgang Mozart in \"Amadeus\": \"You *are* passionate, Herr Mozart ... but you do not *persuade*.\" Simply put, this is a rant. An unambiguous, heartfelt, take-no-prisoners rant, but a wild screed nevertheless and certainly devoid of what I\\'d call reason. Most of it reads like the transcription of a one-sided conversation -- and the translation from Italian into English is painfully bad. (To be fair, we\\'re warned on this score: in a note \"to the English-speaking reader\", Ms. Fallaci takes full responsibility for the translation and admits it contains \"a punctuation and a lexical choice ... which reflects ... my way of writing in Italian.\" I don\\'t read Italian well, but in English this reads like speaking rather than writing -- largely to its detriment.)Regardless, as with any good rant Ms. Fallaci often scores good points. Her historical knowledge of Arab (and consequently Islamic) incursions into Europe is superb and she pulls no punches when describing atrocities that are actually celebrated by modern apologists. Even when punctuated by glibness like \"and do you know what happened next?\" and \"you think I exaggerate? I do not\" her research is solid.Unfortunately, she doesn\\'t support her other broadsides nearly enough. As mentioned, Fallaci\\'s passion is obvious but there are few real arguments here -- much less clearly stated premises. If she wishes to prove \"radical Islamists are systematically and conscientiously invading Europe for the purpose of overthrowing Western Civilization\" (which I surmise is her approximate position), she needed to *say* that and clearly articulate her *reasons*. This lack of coherence is especially frustrating since by the end of this blast I\\'m certain Ms. Fallaci *has* reasons -- and possibly excellent ones at that. But she doesn\\'t highlight them in any fashion and the conversational tone gives the points she does cover an anecdotal feel that doesn\\'t build on any previous evidence. Lack of organization hurts her case as well: chapters are simply numbered and she compounds this confusion by referring back \"to a previous (unnamed) chapter\" which is basically impossible to reference.I never heard the late Ms. Fallaci speak but I understand she was quite good. (The last thirty-odd pages, a transcription of one of her last speeches, bear this out.) Based on this book\\'s plainly \"spoken\" evidence I don\\'t doubt her persuasive skills in this area. Nothing wrong with this per se, but as filling for an argument promising \"the force of reason\" I read it as a missed opportunity. The author was a brave, outspoken, under-appreciated journalist with plenty to say; with clearer arguments and better organization - and perhaps a bit less malice (though it\\'s hard to begrudge her that) -- she would have sharpened the very important points in this book made significantly duller by her style.',\n",
       " \"Let me add my agreement with an earlier review of this book. When I was a graduate student our professor called the book &quot;The poor man's Dirac&quot;--reference to the well-known treatise of P.A.M. Dirac. In fact, Rojansky covers, in a very clear fashion, Dirac's theory of the electron, a topic eschewed by many introductory books on quantum mechanics. One of my professors found fault with the fact that more than 70 intitial pages deal with mathematical preliminaries and classial mechanics. With respect to the latter, apparently he felt it was unnecessary for graduate students who, he assumed, had already spent at least one semester on a good course in classical mechanics. One failing is that Rojansky does not use Dirac notation, although he introduces the technique in the chapter on &quot;The Symbolic Method&quot;.\",\n",
       " \"Joomla is a free, open source content management system and this book, by Hagen Graf, will show you everything about how to install and use Joomla for your website. The only thing you need to get started is PHP, Apache and MySQL. Joomla's modular structure allows the user to customize and extend the basic setup to meet their needs.Graf begins by discussing Joomla's various features and gives a general overview of how the program can be applied in real world situations. He then begins to give step-by-step instructions for how to install Joomla. Because the purpose of Joomla is content management, Graf explains in detail the program's structure and how to enter and organize your content.After covering the default setup, Graf talks about extensions - components, modules and mambots which are three ways to extend and customize Joomla. There are many of these extensions available on the web that can be used with or have been written specifically for Joomla. Graf discusses a few of his favorites. First, he talks about the Simpleboard component and accompanying modules which will add a forum to the Joomla base program. He also covers the Events Calendar component and accompanying modules. Next, he discusses the gallery component called zOOm Media Gallery and the E-Commerce component called VirtueMart.You can customize more than just Joomla's functionality and Graf explains how to create your own webpage templates to customize the appearance of your site. You can even use Adobe Dreamweaver to create these custom templates. Finally, for those readers who have a special need that has not yet been addressed, Graf shows how to create your own extensions.Hagen Graf has been programming since the late 70's and now works in his wife's consulting company as well as many other projects. He has written three computer books in his native German language and two have been translated into English.\",\n",
       " 'Mere Christianity by C.S Lewis was derived from three radio lectures given by the author during the Second World War. Lewis is a well-known mid-twentieth century writer with popular works in a variety of genres; religious fiction, children\\'s fiction, science fiction as well as religion/philosophy.Mere Christianity remains, probably, the most significant twentieth century Christian apologetic text. Lewis employs what is known as the classic approach to apologetics - starting with a general argument for the existence of God then moving on to make the specific case Christianity. Contrary to an earlier reviewer - this is a general introduction aim at the lay reader. Although all readers can find it helpful, it is not aimed at \"intellectuals\". Readers seeking more significant philosophical argumentation on these types of issues may want to look at the likes of Plantinga, Craig, Moreland etc.One small criticism of the book is the last chapter - it has 1940\\'s speculative science fiction feel. Lewis\\' interest in science fiction; coupled with the progressive view of evolution popular among thinkers at the time makes it feel dated and a bit out of place for an introductory text.Overall, Mere Christianity is a classic (The audio version is also tremendous). I highly recommend it as a starting point for anyone interested in Christian apologetics. Readers that enjoy this may also like The Screwtape Letters and the Great Divorce also from Lewis.',\n",

       " \"Although I'm caucasion, I was able to relate to many of the experiences that Maya describes in her book; it's more than the Negro experience in the racist South during the depression of the 30's and early 40's, it's about the tenacity one must adhere to in order to overcome the myriad of obstacles that one endures during a lifetime. It's about finding your voice, and then using it effectively. What makes Maya Angelou's book so poignant is her honest narrative as she journeys back to the little town of Stamps, Arkansas. The reader is almost immediately pulled in to the story because we can simply share in her episodic adventures: Growing up with &quot;Momma&quot;, who is really her grandmother, and a very strict and dedicated Christian woman who doesn't waver from the God's will nor his ten commandments; she deals with an inspiring school teacher who serves as a springboard for Maya's eventual success as a person and writer; Maya also deals with the inequality of the races, the blatant disrespect by the white people, and the mixed feelings she experiences due to her parents uninvolvement with her and her brother, Baily.Maya Angelou is honest and straight forward with her language. This book is clearly one of the best books I've ever read. You have no choice but to be moved. There is something for everyone is this masterpiece. We all want to feel connected, to become a part of the story, if you will, and this book does just that. Maya Angelou is truly gifted as a writer, and we're lucky that a woman named Mrs. Flowers tapped into Maya's talents and encouraged her to expose it. The end result has been an eternal gift for all of us to share.\",\n",

It indirectly asks whether or not children who are seeking an education are selling their cultures out, to become more like their colonisers.

In essence it presents the question of the colonised mind... Good read all in all.\",\n",
       " 'The Norton anthology of Modern Poetry has now been updated and re-edited by Jahan Ramazani, and to excellent effect. The anthology now is split into two volumes, Modern and Contemporary (which here means poets who came of age slightly before or after WWII). Not only has the anthology been expanded, but importantly a poetics section has been added (the last 100+ pages of each volume), which includes Eliot\\'s &quot;Tradition and the Individual Talent&quot; and Mina Loy\\'s &quot;Feminist Manifesto&quot;, parts of Pound\\'s &quot;Blast&quot;, and other important works. This is a smart move, and adds much to the anthology\\'s usefulness.The Modern section begins with &quot;precursors&quot;: Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, Thomas Hardy, G. M. Hopkins. It is nice to see these giants featured prominently; it adds much to the value of the set, and the collection of their works is broad and satisfying. The section then moves on to AE Housman, Yeats, etc. up to Theodore Roethke, Spender and Keith Douglas. The Contemporary volume (slightly thicker, though both are over 1000 pages) takes off from there and includes experimental poets and those of more diversified backgrounds, such as Michael Palmer, Li-Young Lee, and Agha Shahid Ali.Introductory sections to both volumes provide broad overviews of poetic movements (Objectivist, Imagist, etc). While written in a very clear style that will not scare off beginners, these are actually well-researched and thought-through overviews that will be useful to serious students of poetry as well.The packaging is, in my opinion, attractive and sleek: two well designed volumes housed in a cardboard case. The paper is a bit thin and smooth (I suppose it\\'s hard to fit 1000 pages into such relatively slim volumes), but has actually proved most durable. The typeface is compact but fully clear and legible - not at all squished together. In short, the design is very pleasing, such that I find these volumes a pleasure to read and consult whenever I need to.A year since purchasing this two-volume set, I still believe this is the best anthology of modern and contemporary English-language poetry currently on the market, and an excellent value despite its hefty price tag. I\\'m sure many will find disappointments here and questionable decisions - but that holds true for almost any anthology. More people will find something to celebrate here - a remarkable selection of two centuries of great poetry in the English language.A note for teachers: It occurs to me that this volume could be well-suitable for a serious college-level course on poetry (or a very advanced high school course). For those looking for a teaching volume that includes drama and fiction sections, consider Kennedy and Goia\\'s \"Literature: An Introduction to Fiction, Poetry and Drama.\"',\n",

       " 'This is one of the most famous novels by Verne, and justifiedly so. A strange thing is happening in the seas of the world: a gigantic sea monster is terrorizing and sometimes sinking ships. The US government assembles a team of experts and sails around the world to discover the monster and catch it. Among them are two French scientists, Prof. Arronax and his assistant Conseil, and a Canadian harpooner, Ned Land. One day they fall to the sea while chasing the thing, and then are astonished when the monster rescues them. Alas, it turns out it\\'s not a monster, but a machine that can travel under the surface of the waters. That is, a submarine, nonexistent at the time the book was written. So the three men become the prisoners of the enigmatic Captain Nemo and his crew. The \"Nautilus\" is a self-supporting device, lavishly decorated and the work of a genius, a strange one. The central question throughout the book remains: Why have Nemo and his people rejected all contact with their fellow human beings? What happened to him and to them to escape the world and become lonely travellers of the underseas? Mystery. During many months, our heroes travel around the globe, and in the way they discover Atlantida, hunt in submerged forests, rescue a pearl-gatherer, rest in a submerged volcano, and fight aborigines and giant squids. Prof. Arronax classifies and describes every creature they encounter, which slows down the reading between adventures.I took one star out of the book because it lacks a central feature of any great work of literary art: character development. To reach the highest literary glory, Verne lacks psychological depth, the exploration of human beings\\' motivations. I would have loved to know Nemo\\'s story, his reasons for doing what he does. But it doesn\\'t matter much. To read Verne is to come back home, to turn back the time and be a kid again, flying to that moment when one discovers the infinite possibilities of literature, chief among them the chance to live other lives and see the world anew. Verne and his characters have a unique charm, and in this book the fascination od the ocean is added.',\n",

       " '\"Alice in Wonderland\" is a literary classic which has had a vast influence on many writers after Lewis Carroll\\'s time. One can easily see where satiric writers, like Jasper Fforde, get their notion of twisting literary and familiar characters to suit their own purposes. This Wordsworth Classics edition contains \"Alice in Wonderland\" and its sequel, \"Through the Looking Glass\", which is the lesser of the two stories.Most everyone (including those who have not read the book) are familiar with the plot line. Alice follows the White Rabbit down the rabbit hole and finds herself in the strange and exotic world of Wonderland where nothing seems to make sense. As she continues in her journey, she meets a wide variety of characters - some familiar (like Humpty Dumpty) and some specific to Carroll (the Mad Hatter and the March Hare). Because Alice\\'s adventure is truly a dream, what happens in Wonderland does not need to make sense or follow any logical pattern of time or plot. \"Through the Looking Glass\" finds Alice back in Wonderland, this time with the promise of becoming a queen if she can make it across the chess board. The concept of chess ties this story together, but there are few strong elements which make this sequel difficult to stand on its own. It would work better if some of its stories had been incorporated into the original.All in all, \"Alice in Wonderland\" and \"Through the Looking Glass\" are unique escapes into one writer\\'s dreamy imagination. In a way, the oddities wind up making sense, allowing readers to philosophize with Carroll along the way. And for any lover of the English language, some of Carroll\\'s creations (especially the Jabberwocky) are astounding and wonderful plays on words. Sir John Tenniel\\'s classic illustrations help further the story, truly capturing the weirdness of Wonderland and Alice\\'s adventures there.',\n",

       " \"First off, I put Ender in quotes above because while the last few OSC books of this series began with Ender, they have really transformed into the &quot;Shadow&quot; series or more specifically, Bean.Like Ender's Shadow and Shadow of the Hegemon before it, Shadow Puppets is a very entertaining book that follows the Battle School kids progression from training to their journey back to Earth and beyond. In itself the book does a decent job keeping us excited and guessing about characters and their futures. A must read for all &quot;Ender&quot; fans.Now again for the quotation marks. I know from speaking with many fans of this series that the immediate fascination ended with Ender's Game itself. THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE TRAVESTY! Perhaps I hold my allegiances too close, but I felt somewhat betrayed by Bean. While Ender was a reluctant hero, Bean is in many ways very arrogant.While I appreciate their relationship and all of Bean's accomplishments, it saddens me that so many readers have neglected to read through the original ENDER series. While it is true they have little of the strategic battles that made Ender's Game one of my favorite books of all time, they employ such compassion and psychology in a world that Ender chose for himself. Instead of returning home to the celebratory crowds (and Peter) Ender shuttles off to the world of their defeated enemies to colonize and create a new world. In this world visions of the past lead him to do something far nobler than any could imagine. Redemption and education persist and soon through his travel through time, he sacrifices all those who age in order to commit to a better world.All in all, don't miss the &quot;Shadow&quot; series for all the Earthly exploits we all wanted to hear more about, but PLEASE take the time to experience the ages of Ender's wisdom in creating a new world outside the one he left, and his absolute determination to improve the lives of not only those who hold him dear, but those who ultimately he was sent to destroy.Do yourself a favor, read carefully SPEAKER FOR THE DEAD, XENOCIDE, and CHILDREN OF THE MIND! OSC poured more thought provoking material through these three than the rest (however entertaining) combined.\",\n",
       " 'Many readers of AFRICA AND THE VICTORIANS have tended to view the book as little more than a textbook-like chronology of the British scramble for Africa. But the true significance of the book is to expand the highly influential theory of British expansion that the authors originally articulated in \"The Imperialism of Free Trade,\" an article which first appeared in the Economic History Review in 1953.The main argument of the book holds that British expansion in Africa occurred when crises on the periphery led the British government to intervene in defense of Britain\\'s economic and strategic interests. Robinson and Gallagher argue that official thinking during the period of expansion after 1870 represents an essential continuity with the earlier mid-Victorian era, which was characterized by a belief in the benefits of free trade, and by a conviction that British informal influence would secure these economic benefits at the lowest possible cost for the British government. British leaders throughout the nineteenth century thus held the conviction that the government was responsible to intervene in imperial matters only when it was necessary to safeguard the empire of free trade.Expansion in Africa therefore presents a paradox: it remained the continent of least importance to British trade. For Robinson and Gallagher, the answer lies in the prominence accorded to India by British ministers, who rightfully recognized the subcontinent as the linchpin of the Empire. India attracted one-fifth of British trade and overseas investment. It provided for a self-financing Army. It held the key to power in the East.According to this interpretation, the imperial \"scramble for Africa\" after 1882 occurred not as a result of British ministers pursuing economic or commercial interests on the continent, but rather to defend Britain\\'s strategic routes to India from local revolts and from increasing European rivalry. The British occupation of Egypt in 1882 became the decisive event in the imperial revolution in Africa, because it disrupted the European balance of power and set off a scramble. In Egypt and the Nile Valley, the British responded to Mediterranean instability and local revolts by occupying the territories crucial to the protection of the Suez Canal. In southern Africa, the British responded to the growing political preeminence of the gold-rich Transvaal republic by first attempting to cut it off from foreign support, and eventually by pushing the Dutch republic to the brink of war over the issue of British imperial influence on the Cape sea route to India. According to Robinson and Gallagher, there exists little evidence for public demand for empire in Britain, and even less evidence for a direct economic link between British ministers and colonial economic interests. In each of these instances, British motivations for imperial expansion in Africa traced to strategic interests, centered on India and its trade, in response to crises on the \"periphery.\"The main weakness of this otherwise magnificent account lies in its reliance on \"the official mind\" - the statements recorded by British ministers in official documents. This methodological approach supports Robinson and Gallagher\\'s attempt to create a unified theory of British imperialism, but it assumes that the rationale articulated by British ministers in official documents necessarily corresponded with the true motives for expansion -- a shortcoming that later books, especially Cain and Hopkins\\'s BRITISH IMPERIALISM, have made more obvious.In its time (1961), the book was a valuable corrective to the commonly held view of empire, which assumed that British expansion was driven by the search for markets (an influence mainly of J.A. Hobson and Marxist theory). AFRICA AND THE VICTORIANS\\' emphasis on the \"periphery\" also anticipated the growing influence of \"area studies\" and post-colonial scholarship, both of which, in different ways, emphasize the \"agency\" and importance of the non-Western world in shaping imperial outcomes.Nearly fifty years later, this book is still considered one of the most important contributions to British imperial history ever written.',\n",
       " \"For Edgar Rice Burroughs, life was relatively simple. Men fell into one of three categories: muscular heroes, ordinary types, and evil, greasy villains. Women existed primarily to act as universal lighting rods that attracted either the first or third category. Regardless of the universe that ERB wrote of, these constants held with predictable regularity. With the publication of AT THE EARTH'S CORE, he began yet another series that put the hero at odds with nature, evil doers, and beautiful, virtuous women. David Innes, the handsome hero, drills down to the center of the earth in a manner that brings to mind Jules Verne's tale, both of which posit a habitable, temperate core that supports a variety of lush, prehistoric life. Despite knowing that the earth's core was held to be molten, ERB did not hesitate to bend science for the sake of a good tale. ATEC possesses both the plusses of ERB at his best and the negatives at his worst. Like Tarzan, Innes is a likable, manly sort who feels at home regardless of whether home is a jungle or a tea room. The logic of how ERB gets his hero placed in an exotic locale is irrelevant and often purely unscientific. For his Martian (Barsoom) series, he merely had his hero, John Carter, gaze at the Red Planet to effect his transport there. For his inner world series (Pellucidar), Innes used a drill machine, a device that at least tries to be scientific. Once there, Innes has the necessary adventures with beasts, villains, and beautiful women, in this case Dian the Beautiful. The workings of the plot about how he finds her, loses her, and then finds her again are almost not to the point. Where ERB excels in his ability to place the reader, who is usually a 15 year old boy, in a realm that allows imagination to run riot. Events flow so smoothly that the youthful reader will probably overlook the negatives of ERB's prose style. In the world of ERB's muscular heroes, both hero and villain speak in the artificial, courtly dialogue that rings true only to the ears of the young. Coincidence runs rife to the point of ridicule. Beautiful women are haughty at first, but lusty later, and then only to the clean-limbed hero. His plots are often mirror images of one another. You can substitute the center of the earth for Mars, Venus, Africa, or wherever, and hero, villain, and lovely lady are interchangeable. Yet, despite all this, AT THE EARTH'S CORE is the kind of read that ought to be part of any kid's early mental universe. Reading Burroughs as a thirty year old requires a strong ability to suspend one's disbelief, but once having done so, the ride is usually worth the effort.\",\n",

       " \"Men's fear and fascination of monsters have been with us since the dawn of time, and while the imagination of our forefathers was the main source for describing these beasts under the sea, up the snowy mountains or deep in the jungle, our technological and scientific age helped us to unravel a lot of these mysteries,and sadly bringing a lot of nature's animals to the brink of extinction in the process.Yet, this fascination, and apprehension remain with us to this day.While Jaws was responsible for keeping a lot of people out of the water for a while, me included, the portrayal of the great white shark was too over sensualized to be scientifically accurate, something author Peter Benchely tried desperately to redress years later.The man eating Lions of Tsavo, were real yet a rarity in the history of man against 'beast, a historical incident that was all but forgotten, to be revived later with the film Ghost and Darkness.Yet there is another animal out there, and most specifically in the Sundarban region of India, bordering Bangladesh, who also feasts on people each year, and who very little is known about, a mystery as dense as the region it inhabits,(one of the last true wilderness in the world,) the majestic tiger.And to that end, Sy Montgomery has done a wondeful job in investigating this elusive animal, writing a unique book of its kind, that is part natural history, part detective story.The Sundarban tigers are unlike any tigers in India, or in the world. They regularily attack humans, even snatching people from boats in the middle of the river.They are both feared and revered by the locals as creatures of divine power/source(a phenomenon that in itself has allowed many wild animals to coexist in relative peace with humans)However, the plight of the tiger is one tragic story, (some subspecies extinct while others following suit in an alraming speed) and the impression I got from Montgomery's book is not one of fear, although there are some scary moments in the book,tracking the elusive tiger, but one of respect for this beautiful creature. An impression that convinced me these attacks were against people going inside the tiger's territory, invading its lair, as opposed to the well documented cases of man-eating leopards and wolfs that boldly invade human's territory.Saving the Tiger at all costs is another impression I got from this book, a need that becomes ever more pressing, realizing the relenteless onslaught from loss of territory or poaching the tiger faces every day.By all account buy this book, and I guarantee you too will be fascinated by the story of when that beautiful animal do what it is instinctively programmed to do to survive.\",\n",

A tale of two differing personalities, the story is enticing, yet grippingOscar Wilde does an excellent job of revealing the contrasting atmospheres throughout the book. He does a fine job depicting the lighter side of Dorian Gray with images of life and excitement for example when he is getting painted, the light is bright and it takes place near a garden filled with beautiful flowers. Wilde is also able to portray the dark and menacing side in Dorian Gray as he eventually commits murder. Dorian Gray comes off as such a complicated character which makes him so interesting. He wants to fulfill his desires but is unable to do so successfully. People can feel how each person has a part of Dorian Gray in him or her. We all have our flaws we want to fix, but we should not become obsessive over them or it leads to destruction as seen in the book.The story is fascinating in that it is able to capture reader's interest because the mysteries in the plot are so intriguing. Although the book has that characteristic gothic element of a man living without the fear of death or consequence, The picture of Dorian Gray is still an accomplishment because it is written beautifully through the character description.The Picture of Dorian Gray is worth the read, as readers are guaranteed to be captivated by the mysteries the character Dorian Gray holds.\",\n",

       " 'This novel was the first one written by this particular author and, as such, shows the talent that she possessed of telling rich tales full of in-depth descriptions of her characters. Reading this novel was not a totally enjoyable experience for me, probably due to the fact that the writing of a nineteenth century author seemed a little stilted to this twenty-first century reader.The wording was at times difficult to follow, but the use of words was masterful. In this present day and age of instant gratification, the flowery descriptions and the lingering way of dealing with the subject causes the reader to slow down to savor the experience.The first half or two-thirds of the book could have been made more concise to hold the attention of the reader. Too much time was taken in dealing with mundane things. There was little action in the first portion of the book. In fact, there were times that she could have taken a less circuitous route to tell her tale.Miss Austen did an excellent job of describing the mores of the upper and high class society. She employed the use of humor and satire in her writing. The overly dramatic portrayals of heartbrokenness and disappointments were amazingly humorous. The social niceties were well portrayed - the practice of leaving calling cards, the pairing of \"acceptable\" couples, the importance of not marrying beneath one\\'s status.This novel is a must on a reading list of important works and should give the reader a desire to follow by reading Ms. Austen\\'s later works to watch her development as she progressed in her writing career.-----------------------',\n",

She secretly lusts after Ben (one of her co-workers), but he never notices her as anything more than a friend.The first half of the book flows reasonably well. The author either did her homework well, or has an amazing sense of empathy. But after Ben leaves the newspaper to take a glamourous job on a television programme, the story falls apart, following one hard-to-believe event with another, with the author taking up threads of the storyline that had only been briefly mentioned, and completely dropping others.The Internet love that was only briefly discussed in early chapters suddenly figures prominently, and out of the blue, Jemima is going to meet him in Los Angeles. Jemima has lost 100 pounds in 3 months. The author notes that the trainer at Jemima\\'s gym is worried about her sudden huge weight loss, but never says anything, and this is mysteriously never mentioned again. Despite Ben being on a hugely-popular television programme, Jemima never watches (although it had been noted earlier how much time she spent watching television), so isn\\'t aware of his success. The much-lauded surprise ending is anything but a surprise...All in all, it\\'s a disappointing book. Even ignoring all of the happy coincidences, the message that the book sends is anything but self-affirmating. Jemima only finds friends after she becomes a size six. Jemima\\'s Internet love only loves her because of her figure. Ben only notices her after she\\'s lost the weight.

As with \"Warbreaker,\" Sanderson has come up with something unique as the driving force behind a book\\'s universe. Ditto in that the book is entirely self-contained, is well-described, and has several unforeseen and clever plot twists.My biggest problem with the book is the pacing: the first half of the book drags. There are a lot of things being developed, but not too much actually happening. Then, at the midpoint, things pick up dramatically (and even more so at about the 3/4 point). Also, there are one or two places where the main characters seem to have brain failure and fail to grasp something when all the pieces have finally been laid out in front of them. Finally (and most trivially), for no reason I can come up with, I had a tough time keeping the characters\\' names straight.

       " 'Louis dates this book between 1875-1879, with the action taking place in the Mogollon (muggy own) Rim and the Tonto Basin of Arizona Territory. The Apache wars are still in progress as we visit Camp Verde and while there are exposed to Al Seiber. Camp Verde was originally named Fort Lincoln in 1861 when established to protect people from the Apache, the post was originally manned by volunteers, and then later by regular Army in 1866.Al Seiber, 1844-1907, is a name immediately recognizable to any reader of the Apache Wars period. Al was of German ancestry who scouted for the Army, later being chief of scouts over the Apache scouts. Earlier he had fought at Gettysburg, among other civil war battles, receiving at least two wounds. History still holds Al, or \"Sibi\" as he was known by Apaches, with great respect. And his times with both Tom Horn and the Apache Kid remains in the mind of any reader spending time with Dan Thrapp\\'s 1964 biography of Al Seiber.This western novel assumes a somewhat strange storyline in that Tell\\'s wife, Ange Kerry Sackett, comes to harm, and is actually murdered. Not just murdered but strangled to death. It seems very much out of Louis L\\'Amour character in that in all his other novels he continually reinforces the thought that a woman alone would never be harmed by a man, no matter how bad that man may have been. It is therefore somewhat hard to accept, at least for me, that this is the storyline Louis chose to begin one of the Sackett novels. But there it is, and one has to deal with it to try to understand this book.As stated in other reviews, I have all of the L\\'Amour books in hardcover and read them over from time-to-time. In all my reading of his books over the last 40 plus years, this is one of the more unique Sackett books. If you have not read that much L\\'Amour it may not strike you in that manner.One interesting aspect, however, of this western novel is that Louis continually mentions the manner which the Sacketts will come to the aid of any Sackett in trouble. Well, in this novel he shows exactly how that would happen, using the word-of-mouth grapevine the fact that Tell is surrounded by at least 40 gunmen in the Tonto Basin area quickly causes any Sackett hearing of it to ride to Tell\\'s assistance.And it is always pleasant to encounter Cap Roundtree in the Sackett books. And I will let Louis himself describe Cap Roundtree: \"A salty old customer, a mountain man, trapper, cowboy, all-round western man. Dry as alkali dust and twice as bitter. A tough old mountain man who had hunted gold and fought Indians and had the scars to prove it\". That pretty much not only describes Cap Roundtree but can safely be applied to all the Sacketts as well.This book will afford its readers a couple night\\'s reading pleasure.

His devotion to rock collecting keeps him emotionally tied to the cave in the Philippines where, as a soldier, he first learned about stones. Because this cave continually reappears in the book, The Stones Cry Out also reminded me of a painting, a tableau of rocks, caves, and death, where the characters are trapped in single setting, at a single point of time.\",\n",
       " 'Gina Kolata begins an excellent story about the 1918 pandemic. Well-researched accounts about life during the pandemic fill the first chapters of the book. Gripped by the story, I read on eagerly into all hours of the night waiting for the chapter on the investigation of the miners bodies sealed in the permafrost I had followed carefully on the news.As I finished that account, I became concerned; I was almost out of pages and the author had yet to draw the story together. But I pressed on and found that the story just suddenly stopped; as if she had run out of material or energy.Clearly there are no conclusions about the 1918 pandemic at this time, but I would have expected the author to do a better job summarizing the story; perhaps at least a summary of what little we do know. But Gina Kolata quickly wraps up her book and leaves the reader hanging. It really feels like she just got tired and gave up.It is an okay book and will remain in my permanent library. But it could have been so much better if she had written the second half.UPDATE: I recently re-read this book and have lowered my rating to two stars. The book \"just stops\".',\n",

       " \"On Eugenia Riley's webpage, she has tips for suggestions on writing a time travel romance. I believe she should have listened to her own suggestions when developing a Tryst in Time.Over all, the book was very good. The development of the characters was very good, and very believable. Even the descriptions Ms. Riley did of the houses in both eras were very good, I could almost feel myself there.The novel begins when Sarah Jennings loses her brother during the Vietnam War. After a nervous breakdown, she inherits Belle Fontaine, a civil-war plantation, from an elderly family member she has never met. While meditating in the old crumbling manor house, she hears and sees a man from the past, Damien Fontaine.She gets transported back in time to shortly after the death of Damien's brother, Vincy, who was also killed in a war -- The Civil War. Still reeling from the death of his beloved brother, Damien has sheltered himself away from the world, trying to deal with his grief.The story is very interesting (I read this book in one day). The progression of Sarah and Damien's relationship is very fast, but very HOT. The love scenes leave you squirming in your seat, and the dynamic relationship between the two characters is very touching and most times leave you wishing you could travel back in time to meet Damien yourself.The complaint I DO have about A Tryst in Time is the believability of the time travel itself. Traveling in time once is one thing. Maybe even traveling back once, getting thrown forward and maybe finding your way back is another. But in this book, Sarah travels back forth so often you must think there is some kind of spiritual revolving door. One of the aspects of time travel romances that most people love is that this is a freaky thing that doesn't happen every day, for some of Eugenia's characters, it is as normal as brushing your teeth. If you have read Eugenia Riley's Phantom in Time, the constant time traveling back in forth is just about the same in A Tryst in Time. That is the most distracting thing about this novel. Just when you're getting into the groove of Sarah and Damien, she jumps back to the future for a few days, then jumps back in the past. *grrr*If you can get past the annoying revolving time travel part in the book, you will greatly enjoy yourself reading this novel. If you love a classic love story about true love lasting forever, this book is definitely worth a read. ...\",\n",

I recommend that before you read this Manga you become fairly well acquainted with the Sailor Moon series as the TV show has only gotten through Sailor Moon R in the U.S. and this book assumes that you know the characters from the beginning. The only real problems with the book are in the translation to English as some key names were mixed up and some of the storyline is a bit garbled in a very difficult translation between two languages that do not work well together. Like I said, a good read overall as long as you are fairly well acquainted with the Sailor Moon series and characters.',\n",

Apply the tactics in this book and you will make money, even from a hobby site. It helped me make my site (http://mysite.verizon.net/vze48sdz/) and collecting hobby pay for itself. The first chapter ($24k in 24 hrs)is hype, but it makes a good point - work your customer base. Makes a great off the shelf strategy. It is surprising how many sites could benefit from applying the techniques (hobby, commercial and not for profit. There is no reason a not for profit can use affiliate schemes for extra revenue).If you have a hobby site, and want to make it pay, or own a bricks and mortar business and are developing a web site, this book will add value. Allen's book explains how to market on the net simply and effectively.If you have a web site, are good at marketing and you get nothing from the book you are doing well. This is worth a read, just as a check list. You need to apply yourself to make the techniques work, they depend on good content and you will have to have (or develop) reasonable IT skills (or access to someone who does) to exploit this book to the full.Allen's books on real estate involve a fair degree of risk. This book doesn't (it does involve hard work and effort). I am not a big fan of his other texts, but this one is excellent (he uses people with greater expertise to write key chapters).If your cynical about this review, or the book (reasonable), check it out before buying.

       " \"The ten plays in this collection (A Wife for a Life, Thirst, The Web, Warnings, Fog, Recklessness, Abortion, The Movie Man, Servitude, and The Sniper) were all written in the very earliest part of O'Neill's career, from 1913 to 1915, and were (and still are) all overshadowed by the numerous masterpieces O'Neill wrote beginning in 1920 with Beyond the Horizon. In the years before he began writing, O'Neill spent a great deal of time at sea, attempted suicide, and then came down with tuberculosis and spent six months at a sanatarium, where he discovered the works of Strindberg and others and decided to become a playwright. This is all reflected heavily in these plays: one of them deals with a consumptive character, three are set at sea, and a number of them end in suicides. Also, two of them deal with marital infidelity among the wealthy, a topic that I don't think O'Neill ever returns to in his later works but which was a favorite subject of O'Neill's idol Strindberg (in particular, Recklessness relates the affair between a married woman and her servant, which should sound familiar to readers of &quot;Miss Julie.&quot;).All of the plays except the three-act work Servitude are only one act and under thirty pages long. Presumably, O'Neill felt a lot more comfortable at this point in his career sticking to short treatments of matters that were close to him, and this appears to have been a good idea. Pretty much all of the plays in this collection show definite signs of the powerful tragedy for which O'Neill is known, and, considering how short they are, many of them are quite moving and haunting. While O'Neill had not yet reached his full maturity at this stage, he definitely was well-enough prepared to write very good one-act plays. His later, longer and more demanding works are very justifiably more famous than these ones, but if you enjoy O'Neill's better-known plays, his earliest works provide a very good view of the development of his style and talents, and you will probably enjoy them as well.\",\n",
       " 'With a name like Tolkien, any writer would be hard pressed to live up to expectations. I cracked open this British-style courtroom mystery leaving lots of room for grace.Indeed, \"Final Witness\" drew me into its mystery aspects quickly. I was intrigued by the murder of Lady Anne and the subsequent accusations by her son that Sir Peter\\'s assistant/future lover was responsible. On the surface, things seemed straightforward, but the jacket cover and reviewers assured me that unexpected twists lie ahead. I plugged along, waiting for two things to happen: 1) for the characters to make me care about their individual fates, 2) for the plot to take me on divergent paths.Unfortunately, neither happened.Despite well-drawn characters, efficient prose, and a passable plot, I failed to be moved or surprised. I also had a hard time hurdling the issue of a man proposing to his lover on the day of his murdered wife\\'s funeral.I seem to be in the minority, but \"Final Witness\" left me feeling strangely apathetic. Due to Simon Tolkien\\'s writing ability, I\\'d try a second novel, but hope for more of the human touch. Or less of that dry British one.',\n",

It was a time when everyone had fireplaces instead of heaters, paper and pencils instead of computer typing programs and outhouses instead of indoor plumbing. News and letters from the East come every few months on a steamer boat.Caddie comes from a large family. She has 6 brothers and sisters. They have plenty to do to keep them busy on the farm. In summer and winter they all go to school. In the off months, the neighboring town uses the school.Caddie is an 11-year old girl who is a real tomboy. She always takes on her brother's challenges and tries to beat them at everything. She'd much rather work in the fields than stay inside and sew. The neighbors think of her as odd. Not only is Caddie a tomboy, she also befriends the local Native Americans. But Caddie doesn't care, she is a free spirit. I liked that she was true to her self. She's a good role model.What I found most interesting about this book is that it's based on real people. The author, Carol Ryrie Brink, based the whole story on her own grandmother, Caddie Woodhouse. I recommend it very much to people who liked Little House on The Prairie, but those who prefer books with a fast pace should steer clear.

It causes one to focus on the Christ in Christianity and presses the point that the focus should not be on one's goodness or the social values of the world, after one reasonably looks and considers the case for Christianity they will realize that it is true and real and that Christ might be trusted and that the sphere of religion isn't where my focus should be but that of Christ.A must read!

For a plant manager who finds himself in Rogo's place, it is an excellent prescription for what to do now to save your plant. It does not give you theory, but rather a rough and ready process to work with where the chips meet the floor.It does not however solve the basic problem in manufacturing which is &quot;How to achieve competitive advantage.&quot; Since it is focused on plant level reactive management, it does not focus on strategic issues and as well overlooks the beneficial effects that reengineering to a flow process environment could bring.The Boy Scout hike game is a very flawed example that will lead readers astray from good principles. In it he attempts to show that because of statistical fluctuations a balanced line is counterproductive. However the example that he uses is in fact not a balanced line as any lean or flow manufacturing student could point out. The line is not make to demand but push, the processes are way out of control (71% variability in process time), there is no flexibility in the line to handle issues, and there is no management of WIP via Kanban or anything else. He also stacks the deck somewhat in the rolls of the dice to make his point. Students of lean principles know that balanced lines are possible w manufacturing using proper principles such a Kanban, demand pull, etc.If you have a limited amount of time to save your plant, here is a good prescription.

       " 'BRIDGE FOR DUMMIES is a good and generous book and I have no trouble saying it excels over most similar beginners\\' books.Why? It\\'s CONCISE. Kantar, a world-class authority and bridge player, takes the reader who doesn\\'t even know that Aces top Kings and introduces the fundamentals of play. IMHO I don\\'t think he goes too fast for the beginner, but the book is . . .EFFICIENT. Kantar teaches the elements of play before the elements of bidding. He does this by teaching play at notrump (so the tactical elements of a trump suit are not at issue) and generally assumes a 3NT (notrump) contact, which is worth game. And it works quite well; play at bridge is difficult but probably less difficult than bridge bidding. Later on, we can take the strategic and tactical material we use at notrump and apply them to contracts at one of the four suits (Kantar defines trumps as \"wild cards,\" perhaps not strictly according to Hoyle but helpful nonetheless.)COMPREHENSIVE. Kantar goes all the way through trump suits, booking slams (contracts to take all, or all but one, of the card tricks), and other recognizable situations. He has an amiable, at times amusing way of introducing tips and necessary bridge terminology. He\\'s also . . .MODERN. He assumes the use of 5-card majors and will allow an opening with eleven high-card points (HCP to initiates) in a hand at any position if the bid suit is good enough. Weak two-bids, too, of course.I\\'m not crazy about advocating the 11 HCP opener in all positions but this is a very small wrinkle in this engaging and useful book.Notes on production: It is certainly true that the text of BRIDGE FOR DUMMIES is only in black-and-white and does not show red for the red suits of diamonds and hearts, but then neither does the daily bridge column in the newspaper. The FOR DUMMIES series needs to keep costs down, after all. At the time of this writing (July 2008), Amazon has BRIDGE FOR DUMMIES at an attractive discount, so this is a great way to get more book for your buck.',\n",

Preacher is a graphic novel series that starts off with questions and intrigue, leaving readers wanting more.The spirit that has inhabited the preacher is known as Genesis, a burning ball of fire with infant features who was conceived between one of the angels of the Seraphi and a demon from hell. It\\'s an event that was never supposed to happen, and the result is a creation that can challenge the very power of God.

       " 'I can understand why this book isn\\'t everyone\\'s cup of tea--it\\'s not your usual science fiction, instead working much more like modern literary fiction. But I think it\\'s fascinating because the book\\'s structure actually models its subject (which, loosely speaking, is the relationship between chaos and social structure). At points the book feels random and repetitive, but this seems a deliberate comment on the topic at hand. In some ways, Bellwether reminds me quite a bit of Susan Griffin\\'s \"Our Secret\" in terms of how it connects cultural studies and science and the study of an individual\\'s life. The book at first appears to answer questions about how fads work (and if this is all you think about the plot, I can see how the novel might seem overly simplistic), but I think it raises more questions than in answers--and this, too, is replicated in the plot of the book, as it culminates in the start of a new research project.',\n",
       " 'I grew up with Anne Rice\\'s works at a young age, because of my cousin. We would watch the movie adaptation of this incredible book, and I would find myself liking it more and more as I watched it.I remember renting this book from my local public library when I was in high school, and I read it day and night. I took it to school, and even skipped a day of school just to read the last bit of it.I purchased this book again, just this year, right before a convention called C2E2 came along. I wanted to purchase the book for a long time, but when I finally read on C2E2\\'s website that Anne Rice was going to be a guest at the convention... You could not imagine my joy. She seemed very happy to see all of her fans and even hosted a panel with another gentleman. I honestly could not stay for long, because I was too excited that I found myself running down stairs. This was of course to start standing in line to make the autograph session. To no surprise, I found myself at the end of quite a long line. I did not care. I could not wait to meet the author. When I finally did, I was completely starstruck. We had only exchanged a few words like \"Hi. How are you?\" \"Good, and you?\" and I found myself on my way to hang out with some of my friends again.As I\\'ve said, I basically grew up with this series of books... More importantly, I grew up with \\'Interview with the Vampire\\' and \\'The Vampire Lestat (Vampire Chronicles)\\'.I love Anne Rice\\'s writing style. Every time I read the books in this series, I cannot put them down without picking them back up, not even for a moment. I like that the writer does this. She really grabs the attention of her readers, especially ones that have been vampire fans for what seems to have been centuries.I\\'ve read every vampire novel worth reading, and this series IS the best of them all. Do read them. You will not be able to put them down for a moment!',\n",

The book could be useful as a way of looking up something you want to say (if you can find it) and pointing to the chinese writing, but that's about all.Cantonese pronunciation is very complicated, and this book isn't very helpful in explaining it. The section that tries to give a broad introduction to the language is terrible. For example, early on it gives a list of 8 &quot;useful verbs&quot; which is missing staples like &quot;to want&quot; and &quot;to have&quot;, and in fact only has about 3 that are even remotely useful. One of the listed verbs is &quot;to trick&quot; -- a word that every traveller struggling with a language wishes they could remember.The majority of this book is organized by topic. Within each topic, it goes into too much depth to be able to find anything quickly, but being a small book it is not comprehensive at all. The dictionary section in the back is tiny and not very useful either.My copy ended up in a trash can in Hong Kong a few days after I bought it.\",\n",

I suppose it was not a good idea jumping from the satirical work of Vonnegut to the depressingly realistic work of Sinclair. Truly, one does not read this book for the story since Sinclair seems unable to make you feel, against your will, for the characters inside the book. I could not, for the life of me, feel much sympathy for the individual only for the masses of the early 1900s.What is moving is the bleak, terribly real view of Chicago. The book was named well for the details it has to offer. Not only does Sinclair investigate the slaughterhouses but how every high-end, gold-lined pocket has its meandering tendrils around every corporation in the city. From buying houses, to going into saloons to drink ones sorrows away, to jail, to work and to the pain that everything eventually dishes out. There is sympathy for the millions of workers that slaved day in and day out for a few pennies to maybe buy a some food for their starving children.I have to respect this book for what it did for the United States; open the eyes of ignorance to what was really happening in cities around the country and invoke change.

       " \"I cannot believe how long it took me to start reading Bond. I was a massive fan of the older Bond movies when I was young (but not so much the newer ones, after Bond's character became diluted in political correctness). I also love gambling, so I was thrilled to find out how detailed this book got about the intricacies of the casino games. Baccarat has always confused the crap out of me, but now, thanks to Fleming's description, through Bond, I have a fairly good idea how to play it, and would love to try it sometime!In the beginning, Bond is a complete misogynist, and a bit of a racist. I'm no expert, but it's shocking how little he understands women and how their minds work! Then again, I guess that was probably true of most men, back in the '50s, when the book was written.The mission is to out-gamble a powerful and desperate adversary named Le Chiffre. Bond of course pulls it off, and I don't think there's any spoiler in me saying that. The mission, though, is simply a prelude to the love affair between Bond and the female spy whom he worked with. I thought that that story was far more detailed than it would've been in the movie (I haven't seen the movie), taking up 20% of the book. I found it thoroughly satisfying. We get to see Bond's sensitive and philosophical side grow, even start to feel a little sorry for him. I particularly enjoyed his philosophical meanderings on the nature of good and evil.For the most part, though, I found the plot to be somewhat predictable. I think that that's probably because the story is so old now, and elements of it have been borrowed so many times over the years, for so many different spy stories and thrillers. Perhaps if I'd read it in the '50s, it would've garnered a five star review from me!One thing I can say is that the ending was a complete surprise for me, and made it all worthwhile!

       " 'In his introduction to this book, editor/contributor Al Sarrantonio makes clear his high hopes that 999 will prove a worthy successor to such landmark horror anthologies as DARK FORCES and GREAT TALES OF TERROR AND THE SUPERNATURAL. The dust jacket even goes so far as to declare of 999: &#8220;Not only is this the largest anthology of original horror/suspense fiction of all time&#8230;but it is also the finest.&#8221; As it turns out, however, neither the editor&#8217;s high hopes nor the dust jacket&#8217;s hyperbole are justified. 999 is in fact a very average collection of horror tales, with stories that range from pretty awful at worst to quite good, though not exactly excellent, at best, and the bulk of material falling somewhere between those points.Frankly, there are few high points in this collection. Furthermore, the high points of 999 are not particularly striking as far as horror tales go, and are only distinguishable as the points of greatest contrast to the indifferent and unmemorable horror storytelling that comprises most of 999&#8217;s entries.Still some readers might enjoy Tim Power&#8217;s haunting & unusual ghost story &#8220;Itinerary,&#8221; my favorite story here, which manages to be witty, fantastic (in the truest sense of the word), and melancholy without straining for effect. Kim Newman&#8217;s lead-off story, set in a U.S.S.R. under siege from walking dead American tourists, is a great, well-written combination of creepy horror and understated black humor, and makes a strong start for the book. Thomas M. Disch&#8217;s &#8220;The Owl and the Pussycat&#8221; delivers a deep bite in the gentle tones of an innocent children&#8217;s story. Ramsey Campbell&#8217;s &#8220;The Entertainment&#8221; lacks the potency of much of his stunning short fiction and bears a little too much resemblance to Robert Aickman&#8217;s classic chiller &#8220;The Hospice,&#8221; but is nonetheless a thoroughly sinister piece of work suggesting the unnatural horrors that can hide behind seemingly harmless grins.But then there&#8217;s no avoiding the negatives. Bentley Little&#8217;s &#8220;The Theater&#8221; starts off as a dully written reprise of Ramsey Campbell&#8217;s infinitely more frightening &#8220;The Show Goes On,&#8221; and quickly segues into a goofy psychodrama driven by the zero-personality main character&#8217;s unhealthy obsession with vegetables. Stephen King cruises through with a by-the-numbers tale of a demonic painting that could make for a passable episode of NIGHT GALLERY&#8212;one could be forgiven for thinking the editor was satisfied enough just having King&#8217;s name to plaster on the cover, so minor is his contribution. Peter Schneider&#8217;s &#8220;Les Saucisses, Sans Doute&#8221; might be well-intended in its mockery of the pretensions and cheesy glamor rife in &#8220;extreme&#8221; splatter-shock horror, but this short piece is too slight, the kind of thing one might scribble up to pass a lazy lunch-hour. Quite disappointingly, T.E.D. Klein&#8217;s &#8220;Growing Things,&#8221; a surprise contribution from this all-too-unprolific writer, also turns out to be a little insubstantial.The best that can be said is that there are some fine, if unremarkable stories between the covers of 999. However, the &#8220;good&#8221; stories are not good enough nor in sufficient proportion to invite comparisons with truly exceptional horror anthologies, such as the two volumes mentioned at the beginning, or THE OXFORD BOOK OF ENGLISH GHOST STORIES, THE DARK DESCENT, and the SHADOWS series, to name but a few others.',\n",

       " 'Jane Eyre is a novel that follows a woman from the Victorian times in which she struggles to find her true identity and what really brings her happiness. Starting off as an orphan adopted by her aunt who despises her, she works her way up to become a governess. Through her struggle of finding independence in a society where women are looked down upon, she meets Mr. Rochester and hopelessly falls in love with him. Torn between finding independent happiness and romantic happiness, Jane indulges in a self journey fighting between what her heart desires and what her mind wants. Rochester is a man with much power and in a way intimidates Jane with his status but little did Jane know he was hiding a dark secret from her.\"Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and a field for their efforts as much as their brothers do; they suffer from too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags. It is thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.\"Not only is this a dramatic romance novel, but it is also a very eye opening novel in which Jane discovers that women should not confine to the expectations society has provided for them, but instead has a whole world to them for them to explore and obtain.',\n",
       " \"One of the most interesting books I have read, from start to finish. I was intrigued by how the writer George Orwell portrayed each character's personality. Each character had their own unique characteristic. For example, Mr. Floury's character was unique in every aspect imaginable, by the way he tries to help Dr. Veraswami's get elected in the club. He was not always positive, but in some instances he was cruel. There was a demeanor about him that was portrayed very well from start to finish. Other character's worth mentioning is Ma Hla May (Flory's servant); her actions throughout the book were marvelous. Each time she appeared in the scene, her presence was felt strongly. Her actions thoughtout the book were driven by her vanity, which led to her arriving at the church and embarrassing Mr. Flory. Burmese days is one of the most memorable, epic, and historical book on colonization I have read. The book was not just about one-man entrance in a club, but also of the hatred people bestow on each other. Was it their vanity that had driven everyone in the town? Is the failure to socialize extended to the natives ? U Po Kyin, villain who tormented everyone, a man without any sympathy, a man who was known to be notorious throughout the town. Most of the turmoil, which occurred during the book can be traced back to U Po Kyin doings. The addition of U Po Kyin made the book mysterious and full of mayhem. There is nothing one can add to make the book any better. I can say that the book is perfect in all aspect imaginable.\",\n",
       " \"This is Dickens' 3rd last novel, and nothing indicates that he was running out of steam. While this lacks (in my opinion) the energy of &quot;Dombey and Son&quot; (1848), &quot;David Copperfield&quot; (1850), &quot;Bleak House&quot; (1853), or &quot;Hard Times&quot; (1854), it is still a phenomenal piece of literature. Pip is an interesting creation. First we see him as a small child who is victimized by his sister. His brother in law Jo (while not too bright) never approves of Pip's abuse. It is interesting that Dickens wrote this troubled marriage scene soon after his own divorce! It is also painfully tragic when Pip starts to make his way into the world and he has to realize that the kind hearted but simple Jo has to take a back seat to his success. Jaggers offers some welcome comical touches. It is interesting that Pip becomes victimized by a legitimate colleague Orlick and as it turns out, the old thief was his benefactor. (In my opinion the old thief was a literary reincarnation of Fagin.) To this day, I have never forgotten the chills when I discovered that the old thief in the early part of the novel was his benefactor.

       " 'This is the original \"Tibetan Book of the Dead\". All other versions are a toned-down version of this work by different authors who want to accommodate people who do not want to put the work in. You need to put the work in. No one can spoon-feed this kind of wisdom to you.The Tibetan Book of the Dead is an extremely authoritative translation of the original texts of the \"Bardo Thodol\" by Lama Kazi Dawa-Samdup who schooled W.Y.Evans-Wentz in Tibetan Buddhism. The book is an extremely important piece of work for both the scholars of psychology and religion, and the lay person who has the time to spend working on it. The book is also the reality behind the \"Necronomicon\" which has been popularized by fiction writers, such a H.P.Lovecraft, but has been completely taken out of its true context.To begin with, this book is a beautiful book once you truly understand the message that it is trying to convey to the reader - or more correctly, when the reader correctly understands the message that is being conveyed. It has a primordial air to it and is certainly ancient in its wisdom and understanding. The book was translated in the early 1900s and was first published in 1927. Be warned - this book is exceptionally difficult to read because the standard of grammar used is of the highest acumen humanly possibly. Evans-Wentz was a Doctor of Literature, a Doctor of Science and a Master of Arts. If you don\\'t have a full size Oxford dictionary, then you will have trouble reading it. There is also a difficulty in the translation. There are many Tibetan words that do not exist in English so Evans-Wentz sometimes derives a more descriptive meaning behind the message that is trying to be communicated to the reader. Dr. C.G. Jung has written an introduction at the start of the book which is mostly concerned about explaining the Tibetan meaning of the words \"Soul\" and \"Mind\". It is for reasons like these that the book requires multiple readings to fully absorb the information that is being presented. So what exactly is The Tibetan Book of the Dead? It is a corpus with several teachings. Tibetan Buddhist monks believe that if you understand the meaning of death then you will understand the meaning the life. It expounds in detail on the illusions of the human mind and gives a context for working out many questions that are philosophical and spiritual in nature.The book is essentially split into three parts. The first part has introductions from various students of theology, psychology and Buddhism. Evans-Wentz then explains the nature of the book and gives a rough breakdown of what we will find in the \"Bardo Thodol\" and how it is used to help the dead find their way to Nirvana during the after-death ceremonies (like an Irish wake) but also how the book can be used as a guide for the living, which is its true intended purpose. The middle part of the book is the \"Bardo Thodol\" translated directly into English and third part covers the topic of Buddhism in general with references to the different schools of thought and Christianity.The middle part of the book, the actual \"Bardo Thodol\", is split into three parts. There is an introduction at the start which explains the entry into the \"Chikhai Bardo\", the first of the Bardo regions that one automatically enters at the point of death. Then there is the second phase of the \"Bardo Thodol\", the \"Chonyid Bardo\" before the final phase of the \"Bardo Thodol\" the \"Sidpa Bardo\". Essentially these three areas can be explained as - the moment of death and the dawning of the light or nirvana, the karmic illusions of worldly things and finally the rebirth process. However do not think that this means that everybody is reborn or that Tibetans/Buddhists take reincarnation literally. It is all part of a thinking puzzle. You have got to work out things for yourself. There are hidden meanings in there. You must compare the different concepts in this book to find out what it really means! Question the \"Bardo Thodol\". Question what it teaches! Question what it says about itself!The Bardo Thodol is a technical and thoroughly scientific examination of consciousness that is still highly regarded as one of the most logical and controlled methods of understanding the mind and its relation to the world of phenomena. At first glance the book may seem horrid, uncanny and evoke a fear by the mere mention of the word \"death\", but this is a book about the living, dedicated to life and expounds on some of the most important questions that man can ask himself. It is extremely satisfying and worthy of repetitive readings. There is a pile of footnotes to help guide you through each page.Enormously recommended! ! ! !(As a side note Evans-Wentz wrote several other books to follow up on this one. They should be read in the following order - (1)The Tibetan Book of the Dead, (2) Tibet\\'s Great Yogi Milarepa, (3)Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines and (4)The Tibetan Book of the Great Liberation.)',\n",
       " 'Thomas Harris is a masterful suspense genre writer. This is common knowledge. What often get overlooked are the wonderful literary aspects of his work. Silence Of The Lambs works as both a suspense novel and a fine piece of literature.Gender issues are a major theme in this wonderful novel. Buffalo Bill does not kill his victims for money or sexual pleasure or fame. He kills his victims, all of who are female, for the most superficial aspect of their beings, their skin. Buffalo Bill wants to become a woman and he believes wearing women\\'s skin will make him one. I do not need to tell anyone to ask a woman to find out if it is skin that makes a woman what she is. Women are being objectified by Buffalo Bill.Also supporting the theme of gender issues is the compelling character of Clarice Starling. Clarice is an up and coming, star student in the FBI Academy, who wants to become part of the FBI\\'s Behavioral Science Unit. This unit is extremely difficult to get into. Jack Crawford, FBI Section Chief, wants to give Starling a job, however it involves a lot of paper work. \"It was tempting to get into Behavioral Science in any capacity she could, but she knew what happens to a woman if she\\'s ever pegged as a secretary - it sticks until the end of time.\" Starling is trying to avoid falling into the common stereotype of women in the workplace.There are many instances of gender issues in this novel, and if you still do not believe me, read the novel and figure out which room the well is under that Buffalo Bill keeps his victims in. These are not coincidences. The literary aspects are there. There are no `throw-away lines\\' in this novel. To say so would insult Thomas Harris. Every sentence in this novel is there for a reason, whether it be to advance the suspense or to advance the literary themes.Thomas Harris writes an incredible novel that can be enjoyed on a purely suspense genre level or on a literary level.

The focus has been upon the politics, the strategy, the battles, the role of Theodore Roosevelt, and the emergence of America as a world power. A few tell also of the Rough Riders--the men of the west and southwest, recruited from the American Territories--Arizona, New Mexico, Indian Territory, Oklahoma--who became the First Regiment, U.S. Volunteers, and fought in the Cuban campaign.J. C. Stewart's book, &quot;Cowboys in Uniform&quot; is another Spanish-American war book. It is one of several published in 1998--the centennial year of what became known as &quot;a splendid little war.&quot; However, this book is different. Its theme is the personal possessions of the ordinary trooper: the khaki uniform, the haversack that contained the trooper's food and property, the Krag-Jorgenson rifle and its smokeless powder cartridge, and more.The book explains how these men, originally recruited for service in a cavalry regiment were ordered to Cuba without their horses, to fight dismounted. This order was a significant change. After all, these were men recruited for their horsemanship, as well as their experience with firearms, and ability to live and work outdoors--and out of saddlbags--in inhospitable territory. Basically, these were men who practiced the physical arts and skills of the West.Here are detailed descriptions of the clothing worn by the trooper, the haversack he carried, and the rifle he fired. Color photographs of the very few known uniform items that have survived time--and countless spring cleanings--enhance the descriptions. Intriguing also, is the story of how the uniform and other equipment was obtained through the diligence, political connections, and speedy action by Col. Leonard Wood, the actual commander of the Regiment. (Theodore Roosevelt started as a second in command--by his own recommendation.)Photographs by 1898 cameramen show how the uniform and equipment was actually worn and carried. They also show how some troopers modified the uniform, either for practical reasons, or simply to express a little individuality. To provide a clear dimension to how the uniforms and equipment were employed, the author has teamed with several men to model the unforms and show how the quipment ws handled. These are not professional models, but men of the West who are familiar with horses, firearms and the rigors of life outdoors. Indeed, the author, who is also a respected Grand Canyon wrangler, and professional saddle maker (and who looks like a young Col. Roosevelt) models a replica of the khaki uniform that the energetic future President had made-to-order.This is a soft-cover work containing much hard detail, with extensive footnotes in each chapter. There are many more loose ends to the Rough Rider story. The author admits &quot;Cowboys in Uniform&quot; is not his final work on the subject. It is, however, a good first book. Moreover, with several more ISBN numbers registerd to him, we can expect more writing from him on this subject.\",\n",

       " \"I found Henry F. Pringle's biography on Theodore Roosevelt to be bit overrated. Probably because it was published back in 1931 that make the material so dated. Passage of time and reassessment of Theodore Roosevelt make this book somewhat of an oddity. Despite of being published just 12 years after Roosevelt's death, it was interesting to read that this was basically a pretty negative outlook on a great American. The style of his writing, the way he jumped forward and backward simply confused the subject matter sometimes. It doesn't helped that the author never really get into the mind, personality and motives of his subject. Many of the issues surrounding Roosevelt's life are simply not in-depth enough to be interesting or informative.I supposed for readers back in the 1930s, this book had a lot to offered. But nowadays, with works by Edmund Morris, David McCullough, Nathan Miller and Kathleen Dalton, there is really very little purpose in reading this book. It doesn't offered any thing new nor offered any great insights.I read it because it was so highly acclaimed back then. It won the Pulitzer Prize and won high reviews back then. But reading it now after going through many of the modern materials on Roosevelt, make Pringle's work looked weak and stale.Not really recommended for anyone unless your curiousity get aroused by ancient work.\",\n",

       " \"This is the first fiction book I've read in a long time, and I have to say I'm not too disappointed. Fathers and Sons relates not only the generation gap in 19th century Russia, but also shows how fragile and fake the entire Russian system was in that time period. Every character symbolizes an important facet of Russian society. Paul Petrovich is the old slavophile nobility, convinced that Russians and their ways are the best in the world while they wear English clothing and speak and read in French. His brother Nicholas is the bridge between the old world and the new world, trying to fit in with the new ways while he only understands the old customs. Arcady, who represents those in society who outwardly follow the latest trendy beliefs but can't shake their emotions or their humanity. And Barazov, who represents youth, with its eternal promise of new ideas and ways, but who are blind to their own naive hypocrisy. Certainly there are other characters, but these major figures shape the plot of the book.Turgenev manages to leave no stone unturned, casting withering attacks on peasants, psuedo-intellectualism, government officials, corruption, and conventions. The book mentions that Turgenev alienated and angered many in Russia with this book, and the reader will quickly see why.Turgenev recognized the backwardness of Russia, and that it must change if it were to survive in a new world. The big question was how, and Turgenev shows that while idealists like Bazarov may have new ideas (Bazarov's idea was nihilism, a belief in nothing), those ideas mean nothing if not backed up with solutions to the problems.An excellent book, and very readable. The price is low enough that most people really don't have an excuse to give this one a shot.\",\n",

The rave reviews encouraged me to read it.The story is of a man and his son who set out on a motorcycle trip across the upper West and Northwest eventually coming down the coast to California. The man is schizophrenic and interspersed with the travelogue are musings of his other personality (Phaedrus) on everything from motorcycle maintenance to Greek philosophy.Chris, his son, has problems of his own - mostly in dealing with the terrifying illness of his father. As the book progresses that travelogue sections grow shorter and long ramblings on philosophy and meaning-of-life take over.I found myself identifying with the son Chris throughout the book. It was a long joyless ride. I found myself slightly depressed everytime I read a portion. I was glad when I finished. I almost quit a few times but wanted to push through to the end.

       " \"As a first generation Asian immigrant, I thought this book would be a bit of a reflection on my experience. I definitely empathize a lot with the characters in the story, but I didn't sympathize with them (maybe except for Blondie and Wendy, a little bit). Most of the characters are not likeable and are too much like caricatures. The depiction of Asian-American culture is very accurate, although a bit exaggerated at times. It certainly highlights the negatives and the stereotypes of Asian people (such as the submissiveness of the women, the cunning and greed) and I don't think this story would improve race relations.The plot is also quite weak. The book is really just about the everyday lives of the protagonist family. The story is told from multiple points of view simultaneously. As I was reading it, I felt like I was peeking into a group therapy session and it was not a pleasant one. There were little joys (with baby Bailey) and some twists in the story, but I wasn't able to be invested in any of the characters. By the middle of the book, I found it difficult to continue reading; the story didn't capture my imagination and I almost lost interest in finishing the book.I really really wanted to like this book, but in the end, I didn't enjoy reading it. I'm all for dramatic plot lines and stories that are not all rosy or Pollyanna-ish, but the tone of this book is quite a downer throughout and I didn't like it. However, if you're curious about Asian-American culture and a mixed culture/adopted family, this might be an interesting book for you.\",\n",
       " \"As you can see from the table of contents the author traces English eucharistic thought from the Reformation through to the Puritans and on to the Evangelical revivals of the 1700s and then on to the most significant Evangelical divines of the 1800s such as Bishop Ryle. The author also then discusses the Evangelical response to Tractarianism, modern ecumenism and the influence of the Charismatic movement on the Church of England. It is helpful to note that none other than John Wesley celebrated Holy communion five times a week and that George Whitefield too longed to partake of it, sometimes twice on one day. Scholars have concluded that the Wesleyan revivals were also a revival of a high view of the Eucharist inside the Church of England as some 250 hymns were written about the blessings and benefits one receives from the Lord's Supper by none other than Charles Wesley during the first wave of Evangelical revivals that swept through Britain and the Colonies in the mid 1700s. When Evangelicals weren't reacting to High Churchmanship or fending off Anglo-Catholicism we see that they too held a high view of the Eucharist as a means of grace despite the potential problems that might arise when one holds an even higher view of justification by faith.\",\n",

Though the plot of the story was quite good, there was not that much character development of the heroine. None of the characters captured my heart, and my attention just kept wandering.

I had never read anything by Emilie Richards before, but her name is now on my list of authors to watch for. \"Sweet Sea Spirit\" a story I now read every year. This story was written entirely from the heroine (Sandy\\'s) point of view, which was an interesting change from the head-hopping you often find in romance. Sandy is just wonderful, a sweet, plucky woman who marries a serious man and then tries to change herself into what she thinks he wants, not realizing that he fell in love with who she really is. This novella also had some touching \"big family\" moments, which I really enjoyed, but the main focus was on the romance - exactly where it should be. A wonderful story about being true to yourself, I get tears in my eyes every time I read it. Five stars.Though the first story is not worth the money, the second one more than makes up for it.

This book of stories involves ordinary people then, living ordinary lives of decency or indecency, of humor, of humility and of quiet desperation, who just happen to be of Indian descent. Ms. Lahiri uses details of foods, of cooking, of color and of nature in beautiful ways and often as metaphors to exclaim and reveal to the readers, the certain &quot;truths&quot; or &quot;conditions&quot; of her characters. The stories in themselves are interesting enough, if not exactly Earth shattering as all the critics are raving. After all, this book did win the Pulitzer Prize. Fine then, why did I agonize first over buying this book, after reading one story, &quot;A Temporary Matter,&quot; over the Internet? I also agonize over what I think about the book.As an aspiring writer, who came back to her calling after 10 years of trying to ignore the promptings with in me--as Herman Hesse said in &quot;Demian,&quot; why was it so difficult to live in accordance with the promptings from within?--When I first found out that Ms. Lahiri, who is the same age as I am, had won the Pulitzer, my first reaction was incredulity then pure GREEN ENVY! I too was an English major, thought about getting my PhD in literature, but thought better (or worse) and got a terminal graduate degree (ha ha) and entered the professional world (ha ha). Well, yadda, yadda, yadda, I did not want to pay the price of struggling through student debts and living my 20s in the library. Oh well, these are the rewards sometimes--the Pulitzer--well good for her. Fine then.But, I agonized over giving this book 3 stars and not 4, and I agonized over why I was sorely disappointed when I read a book by someone who was my age, also Asian and a fellow writer who had made good. In all fairness, I will preface by saying that I had the same &quot;reaction&quot; but more strongly to Amy Tan's book &quot;Joy Luck Club,&quot; which I enjoyed watching as a movie but DID not like from page one. This is why. As an Asian American, and as a woman, like Ms. Lahiri (and like Ms. Tan), I am ecstatic that we have a literary voice. However, I can not stomach the &quot;exotification&quot; of the Asian experience! It's as simple as that. Another reviewer on Amazon said that she found this book to be a bit too exotic for the average American reader, she thought. Well, let me tell you, who wouldn't find this book ringing a bit exotic. If you lived in India or if you were Indian American, would you consider yourself exotic?? Of course not! So why should this book or any book on anyone who is not of European decent be exotic?? Ms. Lahiri could have made the same observations, same insights and commentaries about the lives of her characters without employing the traditional American practice of &quot;exotification&quot; of experiences that are considered outside of the &quot;NORM,&quot; whatever that is.I have to say in fairness again, that some Southern American writers also exploit, oops, explore the &quot;exotification&quot; of their people. Look at John Berendt with the based on truth &quot;Midnight In the Garden of Good and Evil.&quot; There are many other writers, particularly Southern, as it were, who write short and longer stories about &quot;weird&quot; and &quot;exotic&quot; people and settings. Of course, as someone once said, who wants to read about boring people? True, but does the stories, as in &quot;Interpreter of Maladies,&quot; have to be so formulaic? Do we have to ah and goo goo ga ga over painfully ordinary activities as cooking, written however adroitly, to capture dramatic tension? Do we always have to marvel at the beauty regimens of slathering on coconut oil in our black hairs? Do we always have to marvel how different we are because we don't drive on the right side of the road like Americans? (Ms. Lahiri mentions that in India people drive on the left side of the road, she mentions this no less than in three of the nine stories, most likely to puctuate how different things are from there to here). Do we have to pander to critics and crank out contrived eloquence and cloying exoticism? Lest anyone thinks that this is a personal review, let me tell you, it is. I have high expectations of writers and of critics!\",\n",
       " \"Part Two of Flowers in the Attic.Carrie, Chris and Cathy have escaped the attic at last. Now we get to see how messed up their lives will be.Incase you missed Flowers in the Attic, it's about a greedy woman who decides to hide her kids in a attic from her father. He won't let her inherit if she had any kids from her uncle she was married too. This kids spent four years in the attic waiting for escape as they hit puberty together and commited incest.Now in Petals, we find Chris and Cathy trying to get on with their lives. We watch Cathy try to pull away from Chris, but he knows his sister is his soulmate.Petals is ok at best through most of it as it skips around a lot over several years of their lives. What kills me is Cathy. Just when you think she's going to be ok, she makes the dumbest decision in the world. Things seem ok, then Cathy gets lied too. The author skips a couple chapters of progression, and out of nowhere, Cathy is making the most idiotic decision ever. I won't spoil it, but this disgust me and makes Petals my least favorite under the name. If good writing is making a character so moronic that you can never forget her, then V.C Andrews is the best!But she's not the best. Remember the progression missing? Missing chapters? It's almost like she just decided to do what we won't expect just to tick us off. She tries to correct it later by saying Cathy is impulsive, but she's not. Not enough for this decision. No, this is the worst writing mistake of all time.These first two books are creative and one of a kind, but overall nothing special. They are average, but grabbed our attention as we hoped they would escape the attic and avoid incest. These two books get credit for the fame of the V.C Andrews name and get a ghost writer hired to write in her honor. It's important to remember how she got famous. She writes about tragedy. Usually a family member will do something unspeakable that rips everyone apart. Secrets, incest or forbidden romance, and main characters who are ok, then make a decision that will wreck their lives.The reason to remember this is because that is what the ghost writer is getting paid to imitate.In every book I can think of, he copies at least one of the area's that made her famous. And usually does it better. He gives us a hint of forbidden romance, but thankfully we don't actually see it. He makes us a good main character then has her make one decision that messes everything up. Usually his character decisions are a lot more realistic than Cathy's. He writes four series after this one that are all better. After reading them, I believe he's the reason the VC Andrews name is so popular. He writes some darn good books, then ruins them by the bad character decisions usually. He needs to write like her, to be under her name, but he doesn't have to ruin them. Like she did. If he'd only write for himself, some would be best sellers.Most V.C Andrews books cover tragedy and romance. Their not really a romance, but most have strong secondary romance plots. All most all of them grab us within the first chapter and keep us glued. The ghost writer gives us some amazing stories, but usually leaves us feeling sick as tragedy strikes. Just like this one, except better written.\",\n",

       " \"Although Kaplan attempts to style this dense book as a semi-linear travel narrative, it is actually more of an heavily footnoted eyewitness account of the dramatic transitions occurring in various developing regions. Chock full of provocative and disturbing ideas culled from many social sciences, the book starts with a largely pessimistic 89 pages of West Africa and 37 pages of Egypt. I didn't find anything particularly new or illuminating in these two sections, but they serve as a good introduction to the issues if you aren't familiar with what's happening there, although recent events somewhat date his account of West Africa in particular. It didn't take me long to get fed up with Kaplan's machine gun use of statistics to support his observations. That, and his tendency to repeat himself, undermine his attempts at literary narrative. Fortunately, I came to a deeply engrossing 45 pages of Turkey and the Caucuses, 70 pages of Iran, and 96 pages of Central Asia. These three sections were what made the book for me, even readers already familiar with the areas will find value in Kaplan's account. It was here that Kaplan seemed most comfortable and most knowledgeable. Lots of great info about the ethnic dynamics of the areas and great historical tidbits make these worth interesting even if you don't read the sections before or after. What follows is a sporadically interesting 100 pages on the Indian subcontinent and &quot;Indochina.&quot; The book is greatly aided by its maps, and Kaplan is careful to acknowledge the sources of the ideas he presents. There is also an excellent bibliography for those interested in followup reading. The great value in this book lies in Kaplan's insistence (correct in my belief) that population growth is the single most destabilizing force in the world today and that it must be addressed before all else.\",\n",

Often times, I would put the book down, only to find when I picked it up again, I felt I had accidentally lost my place and gone backwards. Seriously, paragraphs and paragraphs of unnecessary repitition litter this otherwise gripping story of a mother driven to horrific revenge to \"punish\" her husband for his actions. Yes, this is true crime and consistent details among third parties are key - but hearing the same phrases about the father, Mike, again and again certainly supported the fact that Deborah had turned the kids against him - but really, they were mentioned no less than four times throughout (often by the same people, in different conversations) - just to make sure we \"got it.\" Paraphrasing the trial portion also would have been nice. I could have (and did) skip ahead just to get to the climax - after all the story is written in such an anti-Deborah fashion that my mind was made up after the first chapter. After that, there\\'s Mike\\'s letter and an Epilogue which adds no insight or clues that weren\\'t already brought to bear earlier in the book.Overall the story drags at times and could\\'ve been more concisely written.

It was also gratifying to read about his pioneering efforts in bringing safer sex to the gay, X-rated video screen.While checking out this site, I couldn't help but notice that a couple of people had just the opposite opinion of this book.

In my latest writing, I have begun to try to develop an independent style, but this collection consists of poetry from the 1980s and early 1990s.

Some deal with feelings, some with impressions, and some combine the two.I've tried to write poetry for everyone, not necessarily for literary types.

       " 'Oriana Fallaci, a famous journalist and former antifascist partisan, offers her fascinating views on Islam, its history, and the threats facing the Western civilization as well as her personal story that has become even more striking after the 9/11 attacks. For security reasons, Fallaci had to move to America, a country she views as the main hope of the Western civilization, and so do I, a citizen of the Czech Republic.During the last years, she became the target of many fanatical Muslims and their fatwas as well as their left-wing allies who have made her life in Italy virtually impossible: her identification with Master Cecco, a victim of the inquisition, is certainly justified. But it was cancer that ultimately killed this extraordinary woman last week.Much like Fallaci, I count myself as a Christian atheist. As most scientists, I appreciate the tough struggles between science and Christianity in which the Church was wrong. Nevertheless, these old disputes seem rather subtle in comparison with the outrageous recent attacks against the main principles underlying the Western civilization, including the power of reason and arguments as opposed to violence and intimidation. Why were the controversies relatively subtle?As the Pope Benedict XVI, who privately met Fallaci a few months before she died, recently explained in Regensburg, the God of Christianity is restricted by His own words and by the laws of logic and mathematics. Allah is not restricted by anything and his followers are not restricted either. They will do anything to spread their beliefs. This fact is magnified by the ambiguous relation between the Quran and violence. Fallaci explains in detail how the Muslim clerics in Europe - a part of the future Eurabia - teach their believers that they shouldn\\'t be restricted by the local laws.Fallaci writes that the threat that the whole Western civilization faces is amplified by the political correctness and by multicultural utopists many of whom have openly become the fifth column of jihad. I have just read a shameful anti-papal (and anti-Fallaci) article in the Guardian and it looks really scary where we seem to be going.As Fallaci convincingly argues, the presence of Islam in the West is directly proportional to our loss of freedom. Her personal experience is captivating but it is not really new to me because I have been exposed to remotely comparable kind of pressure. Everyone who advocates a principle that is inconvenient for various groups of people that are presented as \"suppressed groups\" and especially for their inferior ideologies - even though these ideologies are really starting to control our lives - is immediately hated by a certain segment of the society and labelled as a racist. I know these things extremely well and it was refreshing to read stories from someone with a similar attitude.This new book as well as Fallaci\\'s example should wake up millions of people and make them realize that if they won\\'t actively try to defend the Western values against the pressure of an Asian religion and against the cancer of political correctness, the civilization as we know it could face a genuine risk of destruction.',\n",

       " \"Noble House is, quite simply, one of the five most enjoyable books I've ever read, and re-read, and re-read, and . . . you get the picture. Clavell has taken the wonderful foundation of Tai-Pan and Shogun and added new levels of depth and complexity.At the beginning of the novel, young Ian Dunross assumes the mantle of Tai-Pan of the Noble House of Struan during a dark and stormy night and a dark and stormy period for the Noble House. The company's holdings are stretched to the limit, and that very night it loses a shipment of valuable contraband at sea. Dunross, heir to the title of Tai-Pan, or supreme leader, is also the kindred spirit to the company's founder, Dirk Struan, the legendary pirate, smuggler, and founder of the Noble House and Hong Kong. Dunross has also inherited the enduring hatred of the family's historical enemies, the Brocks, now personified in Quillan Gornt, head of the Second House. Gornt, a worthy adversary, has his own designs to topple Struan's and take over as the Noble House.But so does everybody else in the novel, it seems, unless the characters are interested in international espionage involving the Soviet Union, Communist China, the United States, or good old England. Triple agents, royalty, thieves, kidnappers, murderers, gangsters, and businessmen rub shoulders in this tempest in the teapot of Hong Kong.The key variables in this play are two Americans on a business trip, who hold the key to finiancial success in Hong Kong. Linc Bartlett is CEO, and his right-hand man is the beautiful woman, K.C. Tcholok. The Americans' ignorance of Hong Kong customs reflects the reader's, and injects a considerable amount of humor into the novel.But, as with Clavell's first novel (Tai-Pan), the center of attention remains the tai-pan. Ian Dunross is the personification of what is good in the British Empire, even though he is as ruthless as they come. He guides the Noble House through a minefield without a map, using his business acumen, guts, and joss to see him through. A climactic ending to an epic story of love, business, and war is immensely satisfying, and leaves you begging for more (just like Tai-Pan, Shogun, and King Rat did before). A must-read!\",\n",

This is not intended to be a slight against Dickens, but rather a testament to the quality of Thomas Hardy's writing.The first chapter alone is a dramatic masterpiece and perfectly sets the rhythm for the rest of the novel. A young man named Michael Henchard and his wife Susan and baby daughter Elizabeth-Jane enter a village where Henchard hopes to find work as a hay-trusser. They go to a country fair where Henchard immediately gets drunk and sells his wife and baby to a sailor. Regretting his actions the next day, Henchard looks for them in vain, swears off liquor for twenty-one years, then takes up residence in a town called Casterbridge.Nineteen years later, Susan, now widowed, and Elizabeth-Jane track Henchard to Casterbridge. It turns out that in the intervening years, Henchard has become a successful granary owner and is now the town's mayor. He welcomes his former wife and daughter, proving himself to be genial but often petty and easily vexed. For one thing, he is in a bitter rivalry with a former employee, a young Scotchman named Donald Farfrae, not only in business but also for the affections of a vixenish woman named Lucetta who has recently moved to town.Hardy wastes no pages unfolding the plot, which is filled with Dickensian intrigue. It chronicles Henchard's relationship with Susan and Elizabeth-Jane after their return, his jealousy over Farfrae and Lucetta (who happens to be Henchard's old flame and inadvertently incites a public scandal because of this), his fear of the discovery of his deceit, and, finally, his feelings of isolation from Elizabeth-Jane and the town he loves. By the end, you realize that Henchard is not a bad man; he's a lonely man who's made the mistake of letting his love for Elizabeth-Jane distort his judgment.Especially impressive is Hardy's prose, which is strong and descriptive without being florid. He has a sharp ear for native dialects, and the dialogue of Casterbridge's inhabitants comes off as genuinely homey chatter rather than just dispensations of information set up to advance the plot. Moreover, like any good fictional place, Casterbridge takes on a vibrant life of its own, offering a realistic bucolic backdrop for this stormy human drama.\",\n",

Madonna (both of them).Harris does throw us a bone (so to speak) by introducing Mason Verger, a former patient of Lecter's to whom the good doctor performed a face-lift with the minor error of forgetting to re-attach the face. Verger's money and power put him in a position to get revenge on Dr. L. but, truth be told, it's his ghoulish features and the conditions under which he exists that make his character interesting.But back to the Doctor. When last seen, he was riding off in the Buenos Aires sunset with the maiden Starling on his arm. Sorry, but that's not how I want to remember him.

I have also read the highly mixed reviews varying from coffee-shop boredom and a philosophy teachers irritation to some people who have genuinely loved this book. I must say that I can sympathise in part with both views. Indeed, if you have already formed some views on philosophy (and you may not be aware that you have) then be prepared, for you may be in for a few irritating moments. However, as is demonstrated by so many who have read and reviewed this book it has been a source of immense enjoyment and for many it seems to have changed their lives for the better. I am not going to bore anyone with the rigours of whether his philosophy is consistent or not but I will say that I am glad that he offers some healthy scepticism to many of todays accepted views.If you want philosophy, do read the book but remember that many of the views are contentious. In other words read with your eyes open and make your own minds up. As some of the less than happy readers have pointed out, there are many good books on philosophy so don't forget about those.As for whether you will be bored or not I think that it is quite clear from the reviews, varying from 5 star to 1 star, that you will just have to read it to find out.

From the first diatribe ridden page to the last anti climatic ludicrus page it is truly horrible. I've read and reread all of Rice's books except for Feast of All Saints and I've liked all of them (except Taltos and to some extent Memnoch the Devil; but at least that book had SOME redeeming qualities, Blood Canticle has NONE). I refuse to even think that the character in this book is actually Lestat. There is almost no similiarity to the Lestat I know very well and love. This is a completely different character who is boring, juvenile, and insipid. None of the characters are consistent with what they were in the previous books. Michael is reduced to just having a hot bod and being Rowan's cast off. Mona is a brainless you know what. Rowan is a shadow of her former self. The love story between Lestat and Rowan is unbelieveable, laughable, ridiculous and painful to have to read. The storyline about the Taltos is almost disgusting and it is beyond that, besides any point I could see the novel might have. I could say so many things about this book. When I heard about the plot about Lestat wanting to be a Saint, I thought it would be very interesting. It is so far from interesting it goes absolutely nowhere. He yammers on and on about some obscure saint, and has nothing insightful to say about the subject. Inexplicably he gives up the subject half way through and goes of to have a relationship with Rowan who he is paired with through some sort of convenience for the author to try to wrap things up. Lestat could have gone out gracefully, but this book cuts his head off and buries him in sludge (not literally of course). I was excited for Julien to be in the book.....he is hardly in it and is ineffectual as a ghost, person, or character. I see no reason for him being in the book at all. I could go on and on.

       " 'I think this is the novel where Chandler started to take his press clippings seriously and tried to write an Important Book. While it\\'s a very good book, the book feels like a lesser sequel to his previous four classic novels perhaps because it strays a little more from its pulp roots. In the earlier books, he showed us the seamy side of Los Angeles, and the characters demonstrated their basic corruption through their actions. There is some of that in this novel as well, but he also feels the need to tell us what Philip Marlowe actually thinks about your average person. \"Tired men in dusty coupes and sedans winced and tightened their grip on the wheel and ploughed on north and west toward home and dinner, the whining of their spoiled children and the gabble of their silly wives.\" True, probably. Pleasant, no. Marlowe also occasionally indulges in self pity. A flawed hero is one thing; an unlikable one is something else altogether.There\\'s no leavening the unpleasantness as even Marlowe himself doesn\\'t come off well. As misanthropic as Marlowe becomes in this novel, you wonder why he even bothers to do his Don Quixote thing. In this book, I think Chandler strays somewhat from his original concept of Marlowe, and the book suffers as a result. Still a good read, but far from classic.',\n",

       " 'I have read many of Salvatore\\'s books over the years and I must say that this book is the worst that I have read. As many reviewers have mentioned, there is very little plot or character development. Many of the battle sequences seem overly ridiculous (Gutbuster brigade charges orc defensive post, easily overwhelming while taking few, if any, losses) or repetitive (reading about orcs assaulting dwarf lines loses its appeal after 15 times). Surprising, since the plot is virtually nonexistent, there seems to be so many plot holes that you, as Schwarzenegger would say, \"could drive a hummer through it\".Anothering disappointing feature is Drizz\\'t. Even though he\\'s a drow master swordsman, he acts like an distraught emo-kid during this book. Reading his internal dialogue which consists of \"I\\'m hurt. Get angry, turn on Hunter mode...\" gets boring fast. The rest of his crew have subjugated their roles to being \"invulnerable\" soldiers killing dozens (perhaps hundreds) of orcs while merely taking the occasional glancing blow.Also, almost all of the supporting characters are exceptionally annoying, especially Pikel and Nanfoodle. Even more annoying are some of the character names. If Nanfoodle doesn\\'t sound ridiculous enough, Cordio Muffinhead is definitely testing the limits of naming convention.I highly discourage anyone from reading this very poorly written series. Newcomers to Salvatore\\'s work should start with the excellent Dark Elf trilogy to see Drizz\\'t in all his glory without the baggage that is Cattibrie, Regis, and Bruenor (I never much liked his one-dimensional companions much, probably due to the fact that they are so one-dimensional; except for when Wulfgar was going through his psychological trauma but even then, he still wasn\\'t very interesting).',\n",

Joyce himself admitted to, and I paraphrase here, including so many \"enigmas and puzzles\" he would keep scholars busy for years and solidify his own immortality. So much for being a humble writer. Of course, one might argue that no writer, by the very act of writing, can exercise humility.Ulysses, since it was first serialized in a mag back in 1922, has always been more about people celebrating Joyce\\'s supposed genius rather than about the book itself. It is, for the most part, a very poorly written book with prose, when the author is busy playing the old \"look at how clever I am with wordcraft\" game, is rather dull and empty.Considered the modernist book of the ages, I recommend reading it first in a structured environment like a college classroom; even if you have to audit the class (maybe you can find a Joyce class at your local college).

       " 'My first encounter with G.K. Chesterton created quite a problem for me. I first read him in the midst of what I can only call a myopic fascination with and nearly obsessive reading of the works of C.S. Lewis in high school and college. In fact, my initial reading of Chesterton was due to Lewis\\' own frequent reference to him and, in that sense, was a kind of corollary extension of the Lewis mania of which I was a willing and joyful victim. So it was that I picked up Chesterton\\'s Orthodoxy, though Lewis himself seemed more fond of his The Everlasting Man.The problem I encountered when reading Orthodoxy was that it deeply challenged my own relatively recent (at the time) conviction of the seminal supremacy of Lewis\\' Mere Christianity. Clearly, I am using \"problem\" here with no small measure of tongue-in-cheek, but I do remember experiencing an acute kind of spiritual sensory overload upon reading Chesterton for the first time. I found myself thinking thoughts that were utterly unthinkable to me at that time. Scandalous thoughts like, \"I think Orthodoxy may actually be more poignant than Mere Christianity.\" Or, \"I think, if I am honest with myself, that I frankly enjoy reading Chesterton more than Lewis.\"I suspect the significance of this (and, of course, it is only significant to my own journey, but it is insignificant in every other conceivable way) can only be understood if I stress how blatantly life-changing, worldview-changing, spiritually-challenging, and path-altering Mere Christianity and the Lewis canon were and are to me. I know that my experience with Lewis and his work was no greater than the myriad similar testimonies of those whose paths and thinking were altered by Lewis\\' writings, but I daresay that it wasn\\'t less. This is, of course, another post for another day, but I will say that Lewis\\' work fell on the heart and mind and eyes and ears of a young fundamentalist Baptist with as much intensity, heat, and, if you will allow it, damage as any literary bomb that ever fell on any unsuspecting soul.When I say, then, that the thought of Chesterton being superior to Lewis was scandalous to my own mind, you must believe that I mean precisely that. It felt almost like a betrayal, except for my being assuaged by the realization that Lewis would have wholeheartedly agreed with the assessment. I should also say that though I would likely claim (I still struggle here) that Chesterton is, overall, more edifying and enjoyable to read than Lewis, I rather suspect that Lewis\\' genius was more thoroughly consistent and, in a sense, more spiritually sober in terms of its overall impact. But even here I waver.I realize that may not make sense, but I truly do not care. If George Bernard Shaw could name the tandem of G.K. Chesterton and Hilaire Belloc \"The Chester-Belloc,\" surely I can be allowed to express my appreciation for \"The Chester-Lewis.\" Certainly, in my own experience, no two writers have so affected me as these two.Why the attraction to Chesterton? I\\'m always trying to flesh this out, but I think, for me, above all else, I am most deeply touched by Chesterton\\'s celebration of paradox, his uncanny demonstration of common sense, and his almost casual but always penetrating evaluations (and often dismissal) of philosophies and ideologies that take themselves too seriously indeed. Of course, there is also Chesterton\\'s deeply contagious sense of joy and wonder, his childlike perception of the sheer miracle of existence. Chesterton\\'s writings (and Chesterton himself) are a wonderful tonic to the malady of societal insanity to which we have all been exposed and with which, to some extent, we have all been affected.In 2003, Roni and I traveled with one of my Doctor of Ministry seminars to England where we spent two weeks completing our course on sight at Cambridge, Oxford, and other locales. (Please note: I do not claim that I \"studied at Oxford\" and find that way of describing the experience misleading. I say this for personal reasons. I would just assume that my peers refrain from saying the same. We did study, and it was at the locale of Oxford and Cambridge, and it occasionally involved meetings with some of their faculty ((like Bruce Winter)), but that is all. Forgive this idiosyncratic digression, but I have my reasons.)While on this trip, in a bookstore in Stratford, England, I picked up Michael Coren\\'s 1989 Gilbert: The Man Who Was G.K. Chesterton. I have only just read it on our recent trip to the 2011 gathering of the Southern Baptist Convention meeting in Phoenix, Arizona. I do suspect that Chesterton would have found that fact amusing.The biography is a solid, often very enjoyable, occasionally mildly frustrating, and seldom uninteresting look at a man who was larger than life in many ways. Coren tells the story with aplomb, and I had difficulty putting it down.Coren offers personal insights and evaluations that stop short of tabloid peering. He is honest about Chesterton\\'s weaknesses without lapsing into vitriol and charitable with Chesterton as a man without lapsing into hero-worship. In this very helpful biography, Coren situates Chesterton squarely in his own day while acknowledging his continuing impact on the many who still turn to his work.Coren provides some fascinating insights into the story of Chesterton\\'s marriage to Frances, his finances, his often surreal but usually charming personal quirks, his literary output, his many significant relationships, his political views, and his spiritual journey. I was struck by the interesting dynamics between Chesterton\\'s friends and the influence of his wife (which, in some ways, mirrored the reaction of C.S. Lewis\\' friends to his wife, Joy.)I do wish he would have spent a bit more time exploring the reactions and receptions of some of Chesterton\\'s major works, particularly Orthodoxy and The Everlasting Man, but it is likely difficult to keep a biography at a managable length if one comments to any significant degree on such a prodigious literary output.In all, Coren\\'s biography is helpful, substantive, balanced, and informative. I certainly do feel that I have an overall better grasp of GKC the man than I did before reading the biography.I do think everybody should have some acquaintance with Chesterton. He is, regrettably, not to everybody\\'s taste. (One of my dearest friends found Orthodoxy virtually unreadable! Though I can\\'t conceive of how such a thing is possible, it apparently is.) Others, particularly Baptist readers, may find Chesterton\\'s Catholicism difficult to handle. I, for one, never fail to learn from Chesterton, even when I disagree with this or that position he might hold.This is a really good biography of a really great man.Wyman Richardson[...]',\n",
       " 'I must admit that beyond my initial attraction to the novel\\'s title I made several attempts over a period of years to settle into the story but could not get past the first several pages. There are many things to throw off potential readers to aged classics like this one, not the least of which is Dickens\\' choice of character names such as Pumblechook, Wopsle and Magwitch, which I at first found absurd and annoying. However on a recent attempt I made it as far as chapter 10 (of 59 total) when it dawned on me suddenly and unexpectedly that I was hooked and that there was no turning back.The unabridged version is not something one can breeze through in an afternoon, especially considering that it requires the development of a certain skill to absorb Dickens\\' narrative style, much as it is with the often difficult prose of Henry James. Some parts read very fast while others are tortuously overwritten creating a virtual standstill as the eyes glaze over and one starts to look for good reasons not to throw the book against the wall and pull out tufts of hair from one\\'s head in frustration - a good editor would do this book no injustice but I am not going to recommend the abridged version because most parts are not to be played with. But as is the case in life, our accomplishments must be earned, and so I will make this promise to those contemplating reading this work: make the effort, put forth the time to read this novel, which is not a short one, and before long it will grow on you and you will come to treasure your time spent with it, and even savour its pages as the story unfolds and comes to an end.It would be so much easier for the many students who are assigned this book to take the low road and read only a study guide and then rent one of the movies of it and then definitely not ace the class, but the intelligent ones could pull off a pass; but they would be cheating themselves of something that one cannot put a price on- a well told story with vibrant characters who share in our capacities to be hurt, to feel joy, to be knocked down and to live life, for what are stories if they are not reflections of ourselves, our desires, our fears, our untold secrets, our ability to connect to other souls and grow or be cut off and wither.Let me tell it to you straight. Dickens is a master storyteller. He has created a legacy that has been surpassed by only a few and is a standalone in terms of sheer narrative prowess. Modern writers, especially screenwriters (like myself, eventually) would do themselves no harm if they took Dickens\\' work to heart and used it as a model for their own for here there are no pyrotechnics, no stretching of rehashed plot ideas into the thinness of an overblown balloon, no exaggerated or contrived formulae, granted there is no small measure of coincidence in his stories, but here there are real characters with beating hearts and flesh, fully capable of a misstep and fall, part of a story that is relevant and timeless and enriching, even necessary to the human spirit if we are to grow and thrive and not kill one another with the evil and savagery that we are all capable of.As Nicole Kidman said during her Oscar acceptance a few years back: \"art is important,\" and for Dickens\\' contribution I am grateful and would be doing a disservice if I did not write this ditty for those that may listen. To Kidman\\'s remark I would like to add that without art, life would no longer be tolerable and not worth living. It even convinces one to stick around for a little while longer. Those who do not feast on classics like \"Great Expectations\" are paying a very heavy price, one that not even Mr. Gates can well afford.',\n",

I tend to have a soft spot for stories that follow human civilization through a rapidly accelerating future history, in particular those that explore technological singularity or singularity-like events, and this one satisfies.',\n",

That of course is the problem for some: this book requires a fairly extensive math background to be really understood. Fakers may try, but the successful will have a pretty good background in mathematics. That said, the discussion of stochastic calculus is better than many have led the casual onlooker to believe.

They loved it! Of course, they weren't quite old enough back then to fully understand or appreciate Louisa May Alcott's version so I'd improvise for them. They would hear about all the fun times the sisters had during the Civil War era. The games they played, how Amy (May) used to draw on her bedroom walls. You see, the wonderful thing about living in this suburb of Boston is the fact that I can drive 15 miles into Concord. Of course, as soon as my girls were old enough, off we went, to the Alcott house where we visited this big rambling house which they'd heard me talk about and by now, had seen in the movies. They SAW Amy's bedroom drawings all over her bedroom wall and her dresses laid out on her bed. They saw everything first hand which was a real treat for them. They didn't seem to enjoy the trip up to the old cemetery where Louise and her 'real life' sisters lay. Not quite as entertaining to youngsters...ha ha. I seem to have told you about the thrill of being able to actually visit the real Alcott surroundings, which seem to be stuck in a time warp with all the original old furnishings inside. So, back to the book. Need I even say it! I'm sure everyone who visits this site has read this wonderful book about a New England family growing up and their many adventures. Sure, we all know Louisa changed the names of her sisters then wrote a book around their lives. You can read this book a million times and never tire of it so imagine how I felt, looking at the actual sites and just imagining in my mind! I saw my girls eyes open wide in wonder! No, not everyone can come to Concord to see the Alcott house but you can pick up this book for your teenagers or just read it again yourself! In case you didn't guess, I LOVE this book.

       " \"I love this book. Charles II is one of my favourite real people in history and this book creates him as a real breathing person. The events of this book were true and most of the story is the one that Charles himself told on the boat as he returned to England as king, 9 years after the event of the book and Samuel Pepys recorded. Because the tale is Charles own story the detail that Georgette Heyer puts in the book are often the king's own memories and the lightheartedness of the character relects his own descriptions of his actions.Charles certainly was an unusual man for his time and the story of his escape may be one of the explanations of why he was a man who wore his kingship very lightly yet valued it above all. It was hard won.True there is no suspense, anyone who reads history knows Charles did escape but if it were not a true tale it would be one which was described as an historical romp.The book does lack the romance of other books but the fact that Georgette Heyer found enough drama in the tale without rewriting recorded history adds to the bookHe was also the protype for the lovable rakes and rogues that Georgette Heyer often made her heros.\",\n",

Tolkien has a keen imagination and a talent for making the reader want to believe in his creations. But there's also an undramatic over-reliance on exposition in his writing that needlessly bogs down the story, ultimately putting a wedge between the characters and reader (at least this one).I wasn't wild about &quot;The Hobbit,&quot; but still wanted to give the world of Middle Earth another try. I thought &quot;The Hobbit&quot; was a pretty good little adventure-quest story spoiled by a not so great ending.I had a similar experience with &quot;Fellowship&quot;. For the first couple hundred pages, Tolkien had me. &quot;Fellowship&quot; wasn't the best book I'd ever read, but I was certainly immersed in the world, and was enjoying turning the pages.You'll have to excuse me for going to the Titanic for a fitting metaphor, but that's the only thing I can think of at the moment. I felt like the book hit its iceberg at the Meeting of Elron, about 2/3 of the way through.The fun-if-slow-going story comes to a screeching halt as Tolkien goes into mind-numbing hyper-exposition mode for close to 30 pages. The story continues on after that, but falteringly--the fatal damage has already been done. The book just gets heavier and heavier after that, until it just can't stay afloat.There are some great passages and concepts in &quot;Fellowship&quot; (I especially liked the psychological insitefulness Tolkien displays in having the ring possess its possessor).

There are simple and glancing directions at the beginning on the stitches used and a few comments and anecdotes, otherwise there is little text in the book.Now for my opinions, I would have liked more examples as I was looking for endings, edges, inspiration on fringe, etc. So for me it was lacking a bit in the finished example section or could have included a gallery which I would have liked even better. I like to know the stories behind the inspiration for pieces so the lack of text was another drawback. Neither was major hence the starrage given.\",\n",
       " \"Le Caf&eacute; de Cadix by Pierrette Lili CampsThis was a very interesting book. The time frame begins around World War II and comes to the current period. The author vividly describes her life in Algiers. Although many times it is difficult to do in a biographical sketch, the author makes her characters come alive for the reader. As you read though the book you soon become one with it. Too often we have forgotten where we come from, I am thankful that Pierrette has not. You find yourself sitting in the caf&eacute; viewing what's going on. You see the people as they struggle to continue their lives amidst the confusion that war brings. You see Pierette grow up before your eyes and fall in love. You see her brother set out on the course that takes him to France.One of the great things, about the book, is the acceptance of people. You see people of different nationalities, different religious backgrounds and class levels living in harmony until the war changes things. You see them all be forced from that lifestyle to something different. You feel the heartache and the joy as you follow them through the author's eyes.Sharing with the author, I discovered that she left out many horrors from this autobiography that she experienced because of the tremendous sadness it brought back to her.I would recommend this book to anyone, on any reading level, especially if you like historical material. The insight that this book gives the reader is well worth the time it takes to read it.\",\n",

Hawthorne's rich use of language adds to what is already an intensely compelling story. Hester Prynne is a standout among a throng of submissive Puritan women and one of the most interesting heroines in literature. She steadfastly stands up for herself and her child's well-being amidst a storm of controversy surrounding her actions. Symbolically and literally, this is a beautiful novel that explores the inner workings of the human heart and various facets of forgiveness, guilt, passion, pride, self-worth, and the standards by which we judge those around us.\",\n",

       " \"Set in the Civil War era in Georgia, Margaret Mitchell's runaway classic Gone With the Wind is the spellbinding historical fiction of the world's best-known southern belle Scarlett O'Hara and the infamous Rhett Butler. The book was later made into one of the most successful films in history, starring Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable as the love-to-hate main characters. Normally, one would despise a person so spoiled and selfish as Scarlett, but Margaret Mitchell writes the emerald-eyed belle and the other characters in the book as multi-faceted, understandable characters, all with surprisingly human emotions and interactions. Through all of her struggles in the course of the novel, Scarlett stays strong, and in the end her will survives and she concludes a strong woman hopeful of what tomorrow will bring. Gone With the Wind is magnificent in its entirety, so complete with accurate historical facts and an unpredictable plot. The narrator follows Scarlett through years of her life, pre-, neo- and post- civil war, building at a quick pace. Scarlett rises again after the deaths of many close to her, after her failed marriage to Rhett, after going home to her beloved plantation of Tara during Reconstruction to find everything gone, and after her unrequited love for Ashley. The book closes with Scarlett pronouncing the famous words, &quot;After all, tomorrow is another day!&quot; Poignant and absolutely enchanting, Gone With the Wind is a book I would recommend to anyone. It cannot be guaranteed that you will enjoy it as I did, but from reading this novel you will gain insight about a true struggle and eventual survival.\",\n",
       " \"Generally speaking I find this book to be a tad misleading. Many financial &quot;gurus&quot; have taunted people with the vision of financial freedom and eternal happiness for years. They are not honest about the fact that by the time you have the &quot;riches&quot; you have so painstakingly saved for, you are physically, emotionally and mentally spent. Both the husband and wife look physically repulsive, you are sick to death of each other after years of psychological game playing and have no emotional strength left to &quot;enjoy&quot; basically anything. I think it's important to realize that every relationship is a gamble and no human is perfect. Beauty fades as the body grows old and our hearts become torn by the torrents and storms of marriage and life events. Family members from both sides pry and fight over any money you have and impose guilt trips on you for any success - considering only a small percentage of people actually acheive this type of wealth before getting a terminal illness or dying tragically. It is much wiser to build a life on the wealth and richness of good friends and great experiences and not roll your dice for a perfect &quot;someday.&quot; My advice would be to save your money, which is basic common sense, and not buy this book. Use the money now, in your life, for something that will make you truly happy.\",\n",

For all Codi Noline's attempts to dissociate from others, her pain is there for us to share. The very fact that Kingsolver doesn't let Codi acknowledge, let alone wallow in, her pain is precisely what makes it so available to the reader.The action is minimal. Nothing blows up. But one thing leads logically to another, and there is plenty of character-driven drama and suspense. The only thing I'd change about the book is that it gets a little preachy here and there. But only a little. And Kingsolver is right.\",\n",

The video listing is the most exhaustive I have ever seen.The addition of various appendixes greatly expands the usefulness and depth of the work. Mr. Martini has provided historical sources and references that will save the researcher much time in his hunt for information. The listing of the Submarine Museums is especially important for those who read Submarine books and want to visit an historical vessel; however it is also important to those who will come along and write submarine books who have no idea of the difference of WWII Submarines and modern Nuclear submarines. The addition of information on deck logs and how and where that information may be obtained is of critical importance to one who wishes to obtain the most detailed information available of what happened in the past.This book is a must have for any serious Submarine reader, researcher or dillitante just beginning his appreciation of Submarines.',\n",

When Spenser starts asking around, he finds that no one knows nothing and that the police seem to be spectacularly unhelpful - and they, especially, seem to want him gone. They insist that Valdez's murder was due to his sexual peccadilloes and nothing else, pointing to the bodily mutilation as proof.Of course, when people want Spenser gone - or when they want him to quit asking questions - that just makes him stick around and ask more questions.When first the sheriff and then the sheriff's son are murdered - after Spenser catches the son smuggling cocaine, apparently for the town's biggest produce warehouser, named Felipe Esteva - the action begins to really heat up.Was Eric Valdez killed because he was getting too close to the truth about the drug trade in Wheaton?

I like in this book how he emphasizes the importance of health, self worth, good relationships and intrinsic motivation as factors in doing well. However, some tips are pretty obvious (don't binge drink, always go to class, exercise, laugh everyday, find an escape) and others are just random (volunteer quietly, don't network, eat alone, make your bed, empty your inbox).It's an okay book, there is some genuinely good advice like, ignore classmate's grades and take hard courses early on but there is a bit of fluff and while I have no doubt this stuff is from Yale, Dartmouth and other top notch students, it's vague and generic advice.

       " 'Why do the spiritually blind insist on reading books without braille? This book by David Wilkerson takes no prisoners -- and that includes heresy hunters and \"lukewarm\" churchgoers (notice I didn\\'t mention Christians). I believe one must be spirit-filled to fully agree with this book. The mood echoes that of a 20th century Jeremiah or Ezekiel -- and the finger of woe is pointed directly at America.I, for one, believe that America is in great danger. I do not claim to be a doomsday prophet; I take notice of the signs of the time. Yes, you don\\'t have to be a spiritual giant to see that TV is immersed in total trash. The author wrote this book back in 1985, and television was bad enough then. Now, just about everything on the screen is coated with sensual sinfulness and dipped in blasphemy and arrogance. And TV has become an undeniable idol for this nation. Nothing at all glorifies God on the big screen (or the \"Babylonian idiot box\", as the author writes).Popular music and its artists bow down to the whims of society rather than to the Living God. I challenge anyone to dispute the fact that both music and television have slipped even further away from God since the 80\\'s. Things have gotten worse dramatically since Elvis\\' 1950-ish gyrations -- now the hip-hop artists glamorize cop shootings and drunken orgies. Rock stars perform their shows under the influence of narcotics and intoxicants. The cross meanwhile is tattoed on their arms and worn around their necks. I\\'ve recently been to a so-called Christian concert and heard some of the bands that stood for Jesus. Personally, I couldn\\'t tell the difference between Slayer and Pillar. It was all head-banging and moshing. The lead singer grunted and growled and wore ripped-up, grungy jeans. His body was covered with tattoos. If Jesus Christ was being glorified during the all the moshing and stage diving, I must have missed it.I say David Wilkerson is right on the money when he prophesies God will judge this nation for such foolishness and rebellion -- and most of all, for making a mockery of His name. Remember, God will not be mocked. Hosea 4:6 says that God\\'s people will be destroyed for lack of knowledge. Very often I see some supposed \"born-again\" Christian artist get on television and sing for Jesus in a video. But I notice the cherry-red lipstick and seductive eye liner and I see her strike lewd glances at the camera and blow kisses, and I say \"Wait a minute! Isn\\'t this supposed supposed to be all about Jesus? Why then do I need to see all the close-ups on her pretty face and slender physique?\" That, to me, is a stumbling block for young men. All I see is cleavage, muscles and hair gel. Just insert \"God\" in the lyrics or a \"thank-you, Jesus\" and the artist becomes an instant Christian role model for some kid.And as for Russia destroying America...it\\'s not too late. It\\'s never too late for stuff like that to happen. Cold War, Shmold War. All the reviewers here who automatically labeled the author of this book a false prophet when the USSR became the Russian Federation ought not to jump the gun. Ever heard of Gog and Magog? Read the book of Daniel. Remember, nobody knows the day or hour. It could happen tomorrow, or in another 500 years.All in all, Set the Trumpet to Thy Mouth is an unpopular warning to all America, a warning of God\\'s condemnation and subsequent punishment for all her harlotries. Like Sodom and Gomorrah, God will obliterate our society (in one hour) by virtue of a Russian nuclear assault (hydrogen holocaust).Take it or leave it. I choose to take it, and cling to holiness. However it happens, we know this world will pass away according to Revelation, and tribulation is unavoidable. If you\\'re washed in the blood of Jesus Christ none of it should matter anyhow.

Where there are wars, where there are divided allegiances, where there are temptations to be resisted, objects of love to be fought for or defended-there, obviously, nobility and heroism have some sense.

       " \"The Merry Wives of Windsor is loved by many people in the world because of the plentiful expressions, skillful characters' description and the natural laughable. It is not only a common comedy, but also a signpost from that we can see many things of the Elizabethan age when the author-William Shakespeare- lived. And this is one of the few works that he composed by himself, in other words, there are no any source to create it. The reason of coming into existence about this is unique and interesting. When Queen Elizabeth watched one of his historical plays (Henry the fourth), she was very pleased with John Falstaff in the play, then she ordered Shakespeare that he would make John be a hero and have him love in another play. It is said that the beginning of the story. There are lots of characters in the play as the other Shakespeare's works. The whole content is, Sir John Falstaff falls in love with Mistress Ford and Mistress Page, but the two mistresses make plan of ill-treating to him to refuse his love and to show their faithful and virtuous hearts to their husbands. Meanwhile, Fenton(a young gentleman), Slender(a country justice's kinsman) and Doctor Caius(a French physician) are all in love with Anne(daughter of Page and Mistress Page), and they think for wining her love respectively. At the end of the story, after Mr. and Mrs. Ford, Mr. and Mrs. Page and others make plans and ill-treat to Falstaff in the woods, all of them get reconciled with, while Anne Page get married with Fenton, and come to an end with joy. Besides them, some people who have strong personalities appear on the stage. For example, Mistress Quickly(Caius' servant) has a ready wit but a little stupid, or Sir Hugh Evans(a Welsh parson) who always speaks in rural accent but it makes us fanny and he plays an active part at the end of this play. We could see Shakespeare's genius in this play for there has many puns and unique accent which used by Hugh Evans. And it bring more cheerful mood to the play and laugh to the audience. Shakespeare described many men who is jealous of their wives or lovers in his works, and one of them is Mr. Ford who appears in this play. He has faith in his wife's affair and it brings some troubles. When this work was written, a woman generally could not get married to a man if he was not permitted by her father. However the times went by, many Pulitans came to insist that men and women could get married only when they loved each other. Fenton has also the pulitanical view for marriage. It was a new thought and I think Anne Page was attracted to his such way of thinking as well as his other good points. Also at that time in England, there was a tendency for every people to criticize about things which were against the social morals through passages of caricatures. For example, it was a fashion of the time for women to wear trousers but people criticized it, or they criticized for jealousy and affairs. In this play, John Falstaff is ill-treated by everyone and has a terrible experiences, and that's because he is immoral and unfair. Like these, this comedy has several points, and we can see the cultural features of the Shakespeare's period. Although I have ever read his works, I thought this one was very interesting and I came to like it the best. The character's personalities are made full use and I could see the author's abilities from that, too. The mistresses play active parts and they are very cheerful, livery and merry just as the title is. I think it made the audience(especially women) enjoy to watch, and the merriness of this play has been one of the most big reasons to attract people even nowadays.\",\n",

       " 'Slaughterhouse-Five is one of the greatest books I have ever read. Kurt Vonnegut narrates the partially autobiographical account of the life of Billy Pilgrim, a fictional World War 2 veteran, as he struggles to make a life for himself after returning from bondage in Dresden, Germany. Vonnegut, known for his unconventional style of writing, fractures the story\\'s time-line claiming that Billy Pilgrim has \"come unstuck\" and is traveling through time, showing us Billy\\'s life as he sees it, not as we would. Using his overlapping time-line to effortlessly juxtapose civilian life after the war with serving as a prisoner in the soon to be incinerated Dresden and life in a zoo of the extraterrestrial plunger-like Tralflamadoreans, Kurt Vonnegut creates a literary masterpiece.In World War 2 Billy Pilgrim finds himself friendless and lost behind enemy lines. Eventually taken as a prisoner of war, Billy finds himself working in a slaughterhouse in Dresden Germany making syrup to nourish pregnant women while he and his fellow soldiers starve to death. In the sixties Billy has returned to the general populous, become a successful optometrist, and after a brief stint in an asylum, married and started a family. Interrupting his life, Billy is abducted by the Tralflamadoreans, a satire of the univocal absurdity of war and human apathy, placed in a zoo, and mated with the movie star Montana Wildhack. As the order of events swirls seemingly capricious, these three plot lines, representative of past, present, and future, all confluence to the eventual climax of the fire bombing of Dresden.Kurt Vonnegut plays with the readers emotions throughout the book forcing the reader\\'s ruminate between laughing out loud and wanting to cry their eyes out. The three main story lines of the book, the war, life after the war, and Tralflamador, each invoke different emotional responses. After bombarding the reader with images of pain and suffering caused by the war, the time-line jumps and replaces the downcast imagery with the ironic story of Pilgrim\\'s life as an optometrist or the ridiculous story of Tralflamador, eviscerating laughter and denying the cathartic reaction of crying just as the reader is about to breakdown. While this may seem hectic and sound cacophonous, Vonnegut pieces the story together in such a way that the ironies of a \"normal\" life and the satirical Tralflamadoreans blend together to heighten the sorrow evoked by the tragic plight of the American prisoners of war as they become emaciated echoes of the men they once were.',\n",

       " \"This is a deeply confused book. The author's intention is to assemble an animal liberation friendly moral philosophy using Darwinian evolution as a platform and Darwin's interpretation of moral sentiment as a guide to drawing out implications not actually present in the Great Man's writings. His is a commendable effort from which much may be learned, but alas he's on Mission Impossible: an evolution platform, whose core teaching is survival of the fittest in the midst of extinction carnage, replaces morality by the brutal doctrine that might makes right.Rachels is aware of this liability. He correctly observes that moral philosophers have largely by-passed Darwinism, or, when they did take note, contrived philosophical arguments to dismiss it (the classic case being G E Moore's proclamation of the `naturalistic fallacy'). This they do because the struggle for existence slaughterhouse, which devalues our species' privileged position by reducing it to animal existence of no intrinsic value, dissipates the sense of the sacred. Rachels accepts that Darwinism indeed cancels the sense of human life's sanctity (called `speciesism'), but would use it positively as an opening to morally valuing all animal life according to its merits. (This is the signature animal lib teaching that human life, in some conditions, is of less value, or of no value, than animal life in contrasting conditions). But what value other than valorization of armed survival can be salvaged? Rachels would extricate himself from this predicament by fancy footwork that offloads social Darwinism to the hapless Herbert Spencer while leaving Darwin untouched (pp. 63f) Alas, the feint will work only you don't know Darwin's colorful social Darwinist pronouncements. Here are a few:** `There is one general law [natural selection] leading to the advancement of all organic beings, namely, multiply, vary, let the strongest live and the weakest die'.** `The advance of civilization depends on the struggle for existence severe to an extreme degree'.** `The inhabitants of each successive period in the world's history have beaten their predecessors in the race for life, and are, in so far, higher in the scale of nature'.** `The more civilized Causasian races have beaten the Turkish hollow in the struggle for existence. Looking to the world in no more distant date, what an endless number of lower races will have been eliminated by the higher civilized races throughout the world.'** 'At some future period ... the civilized races will almost certainly exterminate, and replace, the savage races throughout the world. ... The break between man and his nearest allies will then be wider, for it will intervene between man in a more civilized state, as we may hope, even than the Caucasian, and some ape as low as a baboon, instead of as now between the Negro or Australian [Aborigine] and the gorilla'.I have found that when students are introduced to these statements, they recognize them straight away as patriotic promos for Her Britannic Majesty's colonial dominions and superpower dominance in Europe. No Ifs, Ands, or Buts. They justify shooting savages, not liberating animals. Indeed, the distance between Homo sapiens and the highest apes will increase because those intervening creatures, the `lower races', will be eliminated.This is sufficient to show that the author's mission is impossible, but let me touch on another point. Rachels tours Darwin's most extensive discussion of morality, in the Descent of Man, to consolidate his argument that our kinship with animals, from whom we differ only in degree, opens the path to animal liberation and euthanasia for humans of no value. The ground is the theory of moral sentiment and its key moral phenomenon, instinctive sympathy with kindred creatures. Rachels notes, rightly, Darwin's personal sympathy with animals and his strong reprobation of animal cruelty. This he contrasts, rightly, with the sovereign moral dignity of the human species in Immanuel Kant's moral philosophy. But Darwin cuts the ground from under this line of argument by declaring himself a Kantian! Here's what he says:After stating that the moral sense is man's noblest trait, he quotes with approval Kant's evocation: `Duty! Wonderous thought, that workest neither by fond insinuation, flattery, nor by any threat, but merely by holding up thy naked law in the soul, and so extorting for thyself always reverence...before whom all appetites are dumb...whence they original?' A few pages later he says that the moral person `may say, I am the supreme judge of my own conduct, and in the words of Kant, I will not in my own person violate the dignity of humanity'. Shortly thereafter he commends his interpretation of the social instincts as removing the reproach `of laying the foundation of the most noble part of our nature in the base principle of selfishness'. And the coup de grace to Rachels' interpretation is Darwin's express assertion of a difference in kind between our species and animals, for `we have no reason to suppose that any of the lower animals have [the moral faculty]'. Just as Rachels fails to note Darwin's social Darwinism, so he fails to note his Kantianism. Goodbye animal liberation.This establishes my contention that Rachels' book is confused, but now readers might protest that Darwin was even more confused. How could he put his panegyrics to duty side-by-side with warm endorsement of murderous competition with `inferior races' and inferior social classes? To contemporary sensibility it is outrageous. I have no answer to this question, at least not one that can be briefly stated. I'll leave it at a hint. This inconsistency isn't unique. Nearly all of his major evolutionary theses are similarly afflicted. Which is one reason why the career of Darwinism is marked by fierce battles among his disciples about the true meaning of the doctrine.\",\n",

It's an early novel, an adolescent novel in many ways (and Fowles has all but said as much himself).

Kaku, a physicist at Princeton, has written one of the best surveys of what modern scientists and mathematicians are struggling with - namely resolving the paradox of reconciling quantum mechanics with Einstein's theory of gravity to come to the Theory of Everything, which would explain our universe from its beginning to its eventual end. Kaku writes that in mathematics and theory, it is simpler and more elegant to come at such a theory when dealing with higher dimensions, and thereby introduces ideas such as superstring theory, which works strangely enough, in only 10 and 26 dimensions. Although Kaku deals with the fascinating ideas of parallel worlds, time travel and etc., he examines and approaches these ideas not with a feverish enthusiasm of a sci-fi hack, but with a sober scientific analysis; he quickly puts down many of these sci-fi ideas on scientific grounds while proposing a tantalizing possibility of existence of others.It's not these ideas themselves but Kaku's presentation of them that deserves merit. These ideas have been written about before by other writer/scientists, but never have all the ideas been so convincingly unified and energetically explained for all people. I have no background in science, and found this book fascinating to read for its ideas and passion. There are humorous biographical and autobiographical anecdotes. Many of the concepts are illustrated (albeit a bit poorly), and Kaku does an excellent job of giving us examples for visualization of a concept that he wants to get across.This is an excellent book that serves as an important introduction to one of the central inquiries of modern physics - finding a unified theory to explain the nature of the universe itself.\",\n",

Through the brittle and rather unsympathetic narration of Charles Ryder, the reader is given glimpses of a world sundered by the hypocrisies of sex, religion, and class and the impending cataclysm of World War Two. We come to know the Marchmain family without really knowing them, much as Charles - an outsider himself - does. Still, this does not deflect from our sympathy for Sebastian's alcoholic devolution or the repressed misery of the tragically beautiful Julia.Read the book and then rent the splendid - and faithful - BBC adaptation starring a young Jeremy Irons, Anthony Andrews, and Diana Quick.

Conservatism that we know today originated in the 1940\\'s. Yes, there were some embarrassing and questionable figures that arose, but a foundation was being laid. The book is very intellectually and professionally written with a Christian moral ideology. Micklethwait and Wooldridge also offer comparisons to the rest of the world. The pages are chock full of numbers and poll data. I skipped over the chapter on the 2004 election, and I would have liked to of seen more concentration on conservative beliefs. There is also a short section dealing with the \"far right\". I very much question their position that it is dangerous or even fascist. Then I would say, it is not conservative or Right any more.The authors are actually very critical of the republicans. They go over some of the contradictions in Republican Party. A good portion is devoted to the last Bush. They also spend some time on the socialist Fabian Society; their power not only influenced the liberals and democrats but also republicans and some conservatives as well. They list out influential conservative magazines, institutes, and think tanks---more than I imagined there were. The authors say they are optimistic for the future of conservative growth.Conservatives deal in absolutes, while the liberal deals in relativism. Conservatism has lead to exeptionalism. Let\\'s keep it that way. We should not be afraid to recognize the United States as exceptional. The authors do make good a point that a majority leans to the right, even democrats.

My only complaint is with the sci fi aspect of the story, a child with telekinesis talents which just do NOT exist, and I was surprised given Matthews\\' obvious athiestic views in every one of his books. Plus he uses this as a \"deus ex machina\" to save some of his characters who would otherwise be dead if the child hadn\\'t come to the miraculous rescue with her gift.However this book has LOTS of characters who are colorfully written. Some of them just fade out, not sure why they were there in the first place (many needed chapters given to an artist who paints a nude portrait of a prostitute who wants to be the mistress of the husband of the female sibling in the story.) But this is probably because Matthews is so prolific he just can\\'t stop writing.The story builds up to where there should be a huge climax, but kind of fizzles out. The train chase at the end went on for pages and I skimmed and skipped that. There was an epilogue so we know the fates of all the characters, but also kind of anti-climactical. For the page-turning ability of this book, I give it 5 stars, but for the telekinectic character, 4 stars.I read this in about a week, couldn\\'t put it down, may appeal to fans of Stephen King (who I no longer care for.)Lots of carnage, incest, child rape, a really, really nasty serial killer, basic Matthews menu, but so, so readable!!!!!', 'Good condition book.

While the series is good, the first book moves slowly, and I feel that unless you read books quick you will get disenhartened and bored before long - but if you do make it to the end, one of the best endings of all books awaits. Its other strengths are a believable fantasy world - a human world, with almost no magic, monsters or other races, meaning that the world is understandable and easier to emerse oneself in - like Eddings, without gods.

      "['All the reviews here are so good and thoughtfully written, so I will keep mine short.I was a devoted Christian, who overtime lost faith in a loving God. To much evil and suffering... To many parts in the bible I couldn\\'t believe or that did not make sense to me. Well, I made a decision that I would never be able to believe in a God for sure, that I would find out at death.Instead, \"Divine Intervention\" caused me to receive this book from Pato Banton at a Regga Festival. I saw such deep love and truth in him on stage like no other. He was exactly the same way I was striving to become. So after the show I asked him what source he used to gain such spiritual growth. Ie Bible, Rastafarian Bible, etc. He told me about the Urantia Book, explaining that the information it contained was given to us by beings not of this planet. I started to read it as a skeptic of course, 100% skeptical, but gave it a try due to his loving and kind spirit, and the way he desired for all of us at the show to unite and experience love.Anyway, long story short, the book is amazing, I believe it is truthful. All of the areas in the bible I had problems with were expanded on and explained with so much more detail that every single issue I had, begin to be clear to me. It all makes sense, its so true, its unexplainable.Read it for yourself. If your a Christian, Start with the Jesus papers, or \"the life of Jesus\". I started with the first few paragraphs of the forward, was very interested to read more.

However, I don't understand the obsessiveness with which the fans of the series behave. An interesting read, but should come with the caveat &quot;Don't try this at home,&quot; considering the author's obvious biases on certain issues.\", 'The conclusion to the trilogy, \"Out of the Silent Planet\" and \"Perelandra\". It can be read on its own, but there are moments when it was helpful to have read the previous two. \"Perelandra\" is by far the best of the three. I was disappointed there was no closure to the story. Lewis makes mincemeat of our feeble minds. His insights are amazing and his concept of the world beyond is exquisite. The English dialect can be slightly aggravating.The novel is centered around a university now owned and run by a group of intellectuals set out to change the world by the creation of a \"new man\". They created this new world order front to rid the world of undesirables, evoke a revolution upon the earth, and enforce a police state. The \"worldly\" Ransom is back, but not as one of the main characters. Instead, chosen is a man that is hired on by the university and his wife (who has dreams that are actually real), will together (though conditions separate them) create this \"new man\".Wish you wellScott', '\"The Lord of the Rings\" is usually found in a single volume, or in three volumes: 1) \"The Fellowship of the Ring\", 2) \"The Two Towers\", and 3) \"The Return of the King\". My recommended reading age is 13+ years old, and I recommend reading \"The Hobbit\" first.When I was 15 years old in high school, I had to read \"The Hobbit\" for an English class. After reading that book, the teacher then let us borrow \"The Lord of the Rings\". Before I had started \"The Return of the King\", I had bought my own set of books. After I had read both books, I actually liked \"The Hobbit\" better than \"The Lord of the Rings\" at first - because \"The Hobbit\" was brighter: a fun, grand adventure with more humor, whereas \"The Lord of the Rings\" was darker: a serious, grim life and death struggle for world survival. But by the time I was about 16, the historical significance of \"The Lord of the Rings\" began to appeal more to me. This is especially true if you read Appendices A and B of \"The Lord of the Rings\", and also read \"The Silmarillion\". You begin to understand the rich history of Tolkien\\'s Middle-Earth/ Beleriand creation. How \"The Silmarillion\" brings out the significant events of the First and Second Ages, while the events in \"The Lord of the Rings\" are the culmination of the Third Age...each Age lasting thousands of years and ending with an immensely significant event.It was 25 years before I read \"The Lord of the Rings\" again, but Bilbo, Frodo, Sam, Gandalf, Aragorn, Galadriel, Legolas, Gimli, and many more had become household names! I had matured over those years, and my tastes changed. I was no longer a big fantasy/science-fiction reader: instead I was reading military history. I didn\\'t expect to still love \"The Lord of the Rings\" the way I did as a teenager. I was happily wrong! This is still an exciting book, but I discovered what I really love...it is allegory-type stories. J. R. R. Tolkien himself has said that \"The Lord of the Rings\" is not allegory, because he hated allegory where he felt the author is dictating to the reader what is in their story...and that any other interpretation is incorrect. Tolkien wanted a reader to apply their own experiences and tastes to influence what they were reading. OK, but in real history one can still get allegory if their own experiences and tastes allow it. How many can learn about World War II and not apply the basic allegorical interpretation that good triumphs over evil? I\\'ve heard of, and can understand, several allegorical interpretations of \"The Lord of the Rings\". Frodo is like Jesus Christ: bearing the greatest of burdens for world salvation while being tempted to stray from his purpose, and the weight of the ring is similar to Christ\\'s cross . The One Ring is like the atomic bomb: the ultimate weapon that corrupts whoever uses it, despite even good intentions, into a power-hungry creature of evil. There\\'s an ecological message with the Ents trying to protect trees; and also the natural beauty of various places throughout Middle-Earth, while evil beings try to destroy it all (including the use of mechanical and polluting progress). I also get out of \"The Lord of the Rings\" a sense of a military mission: that Frodo & Sam are behind enemy lines on a mission that could end a war, and that Frodo realizes that getting back home or even staying alive doesn\\'t matter - just completion of the mission...that\\'s also sacrifice, perseverance, & camaraderie so prevalent in the military history I\\'ve read. There\\'s prejudice with years of animosity between elves and dwarves, and how small, kind gestures can begin to erase all those blighted years...also, how people or races can put aside differences to solve a common problem. There\\'s the recognition of the small, common people (citizen soldiers) that perform the greatest, toughest, and most necessary duty in any war. There\\'s world peace in peril and that something needs to be done before it\\'s too late. There\\'s avoiding the easier way out, and facing one\\'s problems and seeing them through to a conclusion despite severe hardships.I feel that Tolkien saw a little bit of himself in many of the good races of his world. The hobbits are like Tolkien because they love food, company, and talking about family. The ents are like Tolkien because of their unbounded love of trees. Gandalf the wizard is like Tolkien because of his exceptional intelligence and purpose of guiding others along the right path. Some men are like Tolkien because of their inner strength and gallantry, while other men show weakness by succumbing to evil...very realistic. But I believe he saw the beauty and enchantment of the elves in his wife, and why he loved both most dearly: that\\'s why on their gravestone Luthien appears after his wife\\'s name, and Beren appears after his name. The dwarves don\\'t seem to resemble Tolkien, but they are present in much folklore, which is linked to his personal love of medieval languages.\"The Lord of the Rings\" is a masterpiece in my opinion, and it\\'s size (over 1000 pages in any printed format) is pretty daunting, but give it a shot! It\\'ll be time well spent. And get ready for adventure, terror, excitement, love, treachery, devotion, monumental historic events, unforgettable battles, military strategy, exotic languages & culture, etc. See what you get out of the book! I think most people will enjoy it and/or be moved by it. And who knows, maybe it\\'ll become your favorite book too!', 'written in a flowing and exciting style ala &quot;Harold Robbins,&quot; the story is mesmerizing from start to finish.

While it is far from accurate history, it is a beautiful legend of the origins of that curious non-Slavic race called the Magyars. Seredy's grasp of myth is readily apparent; her prose is simple enough for an eight- or nine-year-old to understand but she never talks down to the reader, since she uses the universal, spare language of the epic poet.

Instead, the poems examinge Barrett Browning's guilt over her brother's death, her awakening passion for Robert Browning, and her fear of an inability to love. If one looks very closely at these poems, what appears is not a tribute to Browning, but in fact a brilliant woman's realization that her life has been totally sterile, and that she has now been placed in the precarious position of having to make choices that will alter the course of her life. Tehcnically, the poems are brilliant; written with all of Barrett Browning's characteristic blend of caution and verve.\", \"Thomas Hardy's Jude the Obscure, is rather compelling, but not a book you can't put down. Where its grip on the reader lacks, its attacks on a repressive social structure dedicated to conforming to religion make the story applicable to any time and place.Jude, the main character, begins his life as a lower class boy with aspirations to become a great scholar in the illustrious universities of Christminster. Jude puts his heart and soul into a dream he believes attainable, but society and his vices derail him. Hardy shows even an honorable high hoping young man cannot reach the heights of society unless he conforms to its traditions and obligations.Marriage is the example that demonstrates the main characters obligations to society. Jude can't pursue an academic career because of his requirement to please society by marrying Arabella. Jude and Sue are unable to pursue their truest desires because society thwarts them due to their unconventional relationship. The story seems to attack marriage, as none who impart in it are happy, but Hardy is really trying to say that it is society's regard and adherence to tradition that only allows for a mainstream view of life. Society would rather have a man and woman living miserably under marriage vows than living happily but unconventionally in a stable but unmarried family. It is society's harsh judgment that ruins people; not marriage.The book starts off with some sensual action and then moves a bit more slowly as it delves into the interplay between characters that exemplifies the books theme. The pace finally picks up again as the events at the end of the book become more feverish and intense.Overall, the book compresses the reader as he feels the graveness of society's judgment upon unconventionality. It is also intriguing to see the characters fight for what they believe is right despite society's heavy hand upon them.\", \"This book is one of the 1920s most popular, and shows how life was back then. Before the depression, people had fun and would dance carelessly in the night to big bands and fox trot. Gatsby was an interesting character who had sort of a charm to him, and it just shows how during the 20s, not many people cared about affairs, racism, nor drinking. I feel Nick is obsessed with Gatsby because Gatsby has the personality and class he doesn't. The story is somewhat hard to follow at parts, especially near the end, but it has a nostalgic feeling to it, and basically is a portrayal of life during this time period.\", 'This book has been the most significant book that my wife and I have read in the past year (outside of the Bible).

      "[\"Very exciting story, well told. I won't be spoiling anything by telling you how the story begins. It begins with a great hook, and it will hook you.Michael Baisden's altar ego Julian Payne is a talk show host doing a show called Love Lust and Lies. Hmm, sounds familiar. Michael is a very popular talk show host right now in New York City, doing a show called Love Lust and Lies, very similar to Julian's. In fact I was surprised to learn that Michael started out as an author, not a talk show host. Michael IS Julian, except that I hope he was never shot by a stalker. Real person, made-up story. I hope.The book opens with Michael being shot by a female stalker named Olivia Brown. He's being rushed to a hospital, his life in the balance. He's conscious, on a stretcher, and he is asking the emergency medical people if his daughter and his girlfriend are all right. He's not getting any answers from them. Nor is he getting any reassurance from them that he will live.Well, we've all heard that the best way to begin a book is to start with something dramatic. It works here.We are then taken on a long flashback that lasts until the book is nearly over, since the opening scene isn't completed for us until the end of the book. The entire book is taking us through the events leading to the attack.These are some of the characters you will meet in this story. Julian's ten year old daughter Samantha (who is exposed to Olivia Brown as well), his girlfriend Terri (also at risk), his loyal co-worker Mitch, his best bud Eddie the womanizer, and of course the villain of the piece, pretty Olivia. She's pretty for sure, pretty crazy.This is a self published book. I like the new cover, Olivia seen from behind with a gun in her left hand. The book that I have is an older version with a different cover. I wonder if the new version was edited. The one I have really could have used some editing, for misspelled words, left-out words, secretarial stuff. It's not a question of urban language, it's a question of flat out mistakes in a lot of places. It doesn't detract from the story. Who really cares after all. But if I was doing a self published book I'd fix all that.I agree with one of the reviewers on this site who said that Michael is one hell of a self promoter, talking about his previous book The Maintenance Man several times in this book. I guess you don't get where Michael is by hiding your light under a lampshade. Hey world - here I am, pay attention! Check out my other book while you're at it!I like Michael Baisden. He does a good radio show. Too bad I can't listen to it at work anymore. I like the way he teases the women in the radio audience and builds up the men, when he has his War of the Sexes call-in quiz shows.\", 'the book is great ! with many details but not all..the myth of this story its stolen(it was happend in another state and the time on this myth was uncorrect....thats all.. the myth of bw was written on history but not to this town..thanks a lot.bye', \"I am very, very picky and I absolutely love this book. Having read much of Sarah Kramer's blog, I don't think she is in love with herself or arrogant in any way. She seems like a very kind, sincere, warm person who just wants to share her life. I did not like Vegan with A Vengeance or Dreena Burton's books. They have very complicated recipes that taste terrible, with the exception of the desserts.La Dolce Vegan is the kind of food I like: simple, easy, but very tasty. It is worth the price of the book for the Vegan Cheeseburger Pizza recipe alone. If you like the tastes on a burger, you will love this one. I've made it several times, once for a friend who was visiting from out of town, who flipped for it. The mushroom soup is also really, really good. Another recipe I can't stop making is the peanut butter coconut cereal bars with chocolate topping. I am addicted to these and have brought them into my office a few times. Co-workers have asked for the recipe and get excited when they see me arrive with them.The recipes are also economical. The ingredients you have to buy for the pizza will make three pizzas, the ingredients for the cereal bars will make a couple of batches(with tons of cereal left over).As with any cookbook, there are a few duds. The Simple Oatmeal Cookies were terrible, very plain and tasteless. But that's the only bad one I've found. If you like hearty, American cooking with a fun, amusing style, get this book.\", \"Interview with the Vampire has in a way become required reading for any fan of vampires or the acult so many people stummble upon it and some get lost in its detailed-filled pages of eighteenth and ninteenth century life, while others identify with one of many of its intresting and magnetic characters. I found the book to be very intresting in both area's. Anne Rice has a fabulus talent with bringing a character to life on the page while at the same time painting a realistic canvas for that character to live around. I found that the many thought provoking ideas about God vs. Devil, Good vs. Evil, right vs. Wronge were all captured beautifully and let me look at these ideas of life in a completly and sometimes desturbing way. But by fare the biggest grabe that the book gives to the reader is its facinating characters: from the charming and villanis Lestat to the contimplative and regretful Louis and the woman within the child that we come to know as Claudia. The relationships that each character shares with the others is also fasinating. Mostly shown in a sexual way, Louis and Lestat both are attracted to Claudia and it is left up to the reader to truely discover how fare they all went with those feelings and the relationships between Lestat and Louis or Armond and Louis. Overall I found this book to be intresting and an inthrolling read that I couldn't put down. However though, I do not think that it is the world changing event that some fans make it out to be.

Shark. Bachelder keeps a straight face through out most of this short but punchy novel, and displays an ear for the way television cant infiltrates our daily speech, and invades our dream life. Scattered through out the book are a heap of fast and savage rips on Mass Mediated news, sports call-in shows, flouncy entertainment underwhich nothing substantial resides.In this world, experts in the guise of pundits, jocks, philosophers, and academics all feed aan uncountably intrusive technology that renders every distraction and disturbance into an entertainment value, to be used until a new contrived sequence of illusion can be set in place.Bachelder, demonstrating a brevity and incisive wit that trashes the claims made for the word-gorged \"genius\" of D.F. Wallace, writes surely, sharply, with his eye never off his target.Though he does, at times, resort to the sort of post-modernism stylistics and cliches, such as having the author step out from the story to deliver some self-aware discourse on the limits of narrative\\'s capacity to represent the external world fully, completely -- he has a novel or two to go before the lit.critese is pounded out of him -- our author finally reveals a humane side underneath the smart language, and issues forth a funny yet serious warning about our habit of relinquishing our thinking and our capacity to live imagitively over to the hands of data-drunk programmers.A terrific first effort.', \"I have been in sales and marketing for over 30 years and have sat through an uncountable number of training classes in regards to making that all important 'first impression'.This book would put all of them to shame.Here, within these pages, lie little-known secrets to making that impression.

The depth of the author's research was not only readable but believable in every sense. Historically the Bible is in itself fascinating. Reading about Jacob his wifes Leah and Rachel and what signifigance their lives had on history as a whole is very well told here. I truely wish more had been written about Leah's daughter Dinah. The Biblical records were indeed sketchy at best. Here Diamant can only guess what happened. Her take on what could have happened is plausible.

News, Mon, 15 Nov 2004 4:13 PM PST\\'SCRAPBOOK\\' DELIVERS THE GOODS (Headline)By Robert Osborne NEW YORKLiza Minnelli has certainly had her share of publicized woes of late, but something\\'s on the horizon that should cheer her considerably.Scott Schechter has compiled a magnificent book on the one aspect of L. M. that always seems to get short shrift or is altogether ignored these days, i. e.,her years of delivering the goods in front of cameras and on stages throughout the world. That work has won her, to date, an Oscar (1972), three Tonys (1965, \\'74, \\'78), an Emmy (1973), a Grammy (1989), two Golden Globes (1973, \\'86) and an ever-loyal fan base, something Schechter covers in monumental detail in \"The Liza Minnelli Scrapbook,\" in bookstores this month via Citadel Press, with a foreword by Billy Stritch.No stone is left unturned in looking at the career of Minnelli and, for a refreshing change, no stone is hurled at her, either; here, it\\'s strictly Liza\\'s professional life and accomplishments that the author is emphasizing. And nothing goes unrecorded, be it a TV \"Match Game\" appearance on NBC in 1967, a 1987 concert in Stockholm, Sweden, or, this year, singing \"Oscar\" and \"God Bless the Child\" at a private party at the Ars Nova Theatre in New York. Besides being a dandy reference guide for anyone hunting for a Minnelli fact,\"Scrapbook\" also includes plenty of interesting info onMinnelli projects that came close to happening but didn\\'t. She was announced, for instance, in 1975, and again in \\'77 and \\'79, to star in the film version of \"Chicago,\" playing Velma to Goldie Hawn s Roxie Hart (with, at one point, Allan Carr producing, Frank Sinatra playing the lawyer, NancyWalker as the prison matron and Carol Channing and Ann Miller as competing newspaper reporters); later, in 1992, it was rescheduled but with adifference: Lewis Gilbert was to direct, with Liza switched to the role of Roxie and Goldie as Velma.We all know how that turned out. In 1982, Liza tested for what was to be an \"Evita\" directed by Ken Russell; she sang \"Don\\'t Cry for Me, Argentina,\" causing Russell to publicly comment, \"We had found our Evita\"; the entire venture, however, was KO\\'d until it was finally made 14 years later with a different leading lady. Schechter also lists dozens of other projects thatalmost happened (\"Sunset Boulevard,\" \"The Carmen Miranda Story\") and, carrying out the \"scrapbook\" motif, there are miscellaneous color photographs, candids and reproductions of Playbill and album covers and Liza-related ads. One thing comes through loud and clear: The lady may liketo play, but she has also worked.****The NY POST -- \"PAGE SIX\" -- Sunday, November 14th, 2004 :HITS THE SPOT :IT\\'S not all bad news about Liza Minnelli, who was just hit with a lawsuit by her former chauffeur. At the book party for Scott Schechter\\'s \"Liza Minnelli Scrapbook\" tribute tome, the author announced Minnelli\\'s first theatrical movie since \"Stepping Out\" in 1991. Liza will play an offbeat self-help seminar leader who helps Parker Posey on her quest to find her G-spot, in \"The Oh in Ohio.\" It co-stars Danny DeVito and Mischa Barton.****The SECOND Review of \"The Liza Minnelli Scrapbook\" this one by Phill Hall of Boston\\'s EDGE and also to appear in the NY RESIDENT paper in a few weeks :\"The Liza Minnelli Scrapbook\" by Scott SchechterGrade: A+by Phil HallEDGE Literature CriticMonday Nov 1, 2004Just from the title alone, \"The Liza Minnelli Scrapbook\" seems predestined to find a place on the coffee table of many gay homes. But forget the stereotypical gay worship of this show biz icon and zoom in on the rich contents. Scott Schechter\\'s extraordinary tribute to Liza with a \"Z\" is brilliantly researched, lavishly illustrated and endlessly entertaining. It is impossible to come away from this book without possessing a deeper love and respect for Minnelli.Schechter breaks down Minnelli\\'s career in a neat manner: a decade-by-decade career-based mini-biography (all scandals are removed from print), followed by a chronological appreciation of Minnelli\\'s theater, film, television, recording and concert careers. Schechter uncovers a wealth of long-forgotten facts and photographs which will delight Minnelli\\'s fans: Minnelli dancing on stage with then-unknown Elliott Gould in a touring company of \"The Fantasticks,\" her simultaneous Time and Newsweek covers for \"Cabaret\" (and you thought Bruce Springsteen was the only entertainer to accomplish that?)The book is also rich with Minnelli trivia, including unlikely appearances such as a concert for the inmates of a Chicago jail (two months after she won the \"Cabaret\" Oscar). There is also an unexpectedly large amount of little-known data on projects which Minnelli either turned down (including the role of Daisy in \"The Great Gatsby\" opposite Robert Redford) or which fell apart before production began (including the film version of \"Evita\" under Ken Russell\\'s direction).Schechter is uncommonly generous to Minnelli, to the point of presenting the most glamorous and flattering photographs available; later-life tabloid photographs which show Minnelli\\'s problems with weight control are conspicuously absent. Yes, \"The Liza Minnelli Scrapbook\" is a love letter to the great star. And honestly, what\\'s wrong with a love letter to someone who truly earned the love of her fans?Citadel Press, $21.95, 228 pages****The FIRST REVIEW for \"The Liza Minnelli Scrapbook\"LIZ SMITH : NY Post -- Friday, November 5th, 2004\"DEDICATED TO Liza Minnelli\\'s artistry.\" That\\'s what it says on page one of Scott Schechter\\'s \"The Liza Minnelli Scrapbook\" (Citadel Press). This is a glossy valentine to the great star, concentrating on her long, award-laden stage, screen and recording career. The sensation of her \"private\" life is not emphasized. Tons of previously unseen photos and plenty of Minnelli minutiae. (Her first reviews, even as an awkward teen, are a thrill to read; she had style from the start!) Flip through this and be reminded that Liza is an artist, one whose commitment to her audience never wavers.****', \"This writer is a genius!! His storytelling is superb! I read the first Mummy and then saw the movie. I have read many movie adapations and by far, he is the best adapter of them all. When I heard this one was being released, I immediatly bought it. And as with the first, was never disappointed. He expresses wonderful emotions throughout. His descriptions of the events and how the characters look and feel is incredible!! I am already looking for other books by this author! Another thing about how he writes, you don't feel disappointed when you see the movie. I feel weary reading the book first, before the movie. But never get disappointed! A MUST read for ANY mummy fan!!!!!\", \"Enter a world of dark shadows, private dicks, and dames. Gardner's novel is hard-boiled and thrilling. Don't expect much characterization from Gardner, though; his specialty is non-stop action. Although the plot is a bit convoluted and at times difficult to follow, I really enjoyed the fast pace and sense of place. Highly recommended!\", \"The title is a little bit of a misnomer. One gets the idea you will be reading a story of conspiracy against the German dictator by German army officers. What one gets is the story of German army officers misleading Hitler and letting the Allies win at the Normandy invasion. Even this is not really proved. The author footnotes many authors that have proven false themselves. An author he quotes even wrote a book about Hitler purporting him to be alive in South America. Johnson gives a lot of attention to Canaris, as the master of this conspiracy. Most don't know what this shadowy figure gave in the resistance movement. There are a lot of theories but very little actual proof. This book is unfounded in many things on the Normandy invasion.This book gives a lot of trivial facts about the Normandy invasion, but little in the way of proof of what the author alleged happened. Not a difficult book, but the reader must understand that what is written is not always true.\", \"When I was a child, I remember watching the cartoon version of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and loving every second of it. I was suprised at how well the story was rounded, even though it had been translated into a cartoon. I had no idea, however, that the real magic of the story is told in the pages of Tolkien's masterpiece. When it was first published in 1937, the publisher and Tolkien had no idea that it would blossom and grow as it has (few authors think that their books will do as well as Tolkien's, and can only hope for the high mark which Mr. Tolkien has achieved.) Now, 62 years later, we find that it is perhaps THE most beloved book of the century.The well rounded plot and interesting, dynamic characters make &quot;The Hobbit&quot; the finist book in it's genre. Many other authors have tried to emulate Tolkien's masterful performance, but have all fallen utterly short of the high mark which Tolkien sites at. In my book, J.R.R. Tolkien will be one of the greatest authors in fantasy, and his wonderful and enchanting works will never lose their literary quality or magic.\", \"NORTH OF HAVANA by Randy Wayne White is Doc Ford's fifth adventure. I think it is a bounce back form the fourth and a great read. This one takes place in Cuba as Doc and love interest Dewey Nye boat to Cuba to get buddy Tomlinson and is boat realeased. Not as much a Florida story as normal but a good well paced book with the normal humor you go to expect from White. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.\", 'This book drew the line at what I actually needed to know and what was unimportant for the AP Test. I feel that it helped me review all the major points and really contributed to my performance on the exam.', \"I needed to read this for an AP English class, and because of the extremely beautiful cover, I bought it. I was pleased to see it arriving on time, but I was slightly sad to see that the font was not what I expected. I usually like smaller, more squarish words, but the words in the book are rather large, sort of like large-print, and the shapes were sort of vertical-retangular. It doesn't have anything to actually do with the content of the book (which by the way, is beautiful. Who doesn't love a tale of people going insane?), but I wish that the publishers had put a nicer font in it.I'd give it a 5, but I really sort of felt disappointed over the words.\", 'My 4 year old daughter loves the Nutcracker, but we were disappointed that this book contains an overly abbreviated version with cartoon drawings rather than a nice photo like you see on the cover.', 'Many movies and novels have been written about the colony type ships and their trips to the stars. This 1967 novel is a fine example of this type of novel.', \"Caitlin Kiernan's Silk is a book about the darknes and corruption that exists just below the surface, perhaps just below all surfaces, just out of sight. The basement of a dilapidated old house, the skin of our bodies, trapdoors that have been nailed shut, repressed memories, the subconcious mind - all these are merely a mask drawn over a terrifying, half-suspected reality. No doubt, Kiernan has one of the strongest, most distinct voices in weird and horror fiction today and, more importantly, she has the skill to back it up. Silk is a deliciously-written book, an absolute word-storm. I'm not used to discovering fantasy and horror authors who are willing to go beyond telling the same old, scary stories, the same safe, predicatble rubbish of vampires and murderous psychos, and chart new territories of the bizarre. But that's what Silk does. This is not a book to miss. Five stars!!\", 'Ken Follett has developed a plot wrapped around modern issues of test tube children and computer data bases. The characters bumble around a little too much to give the book a five star rating, but it is a well written novel of modern times. A secondary theme is the issue of academic freedom and the manipulations within a major research university. Well worth reading.', \"It has been years since I've enjoyed a novel more. I am a Steinbeck fan for sure but somehow I'd never read Grapes. You will not be disappointed. Not only are the characters and the story compelling, it is a detailed contrast of America 80 years ago that offers some stark differences (and similarities) with America today.\", \"So maybe I'm not your typical high school student. I was prepared to love this book, so I came in with more patience and excitement than most, probably. What I found, through a month-long picking apart of this book in my Lit. Class, was that I loved it more than I ever could have imagined. I flew through it! This book is a high-gear powerhouse of emotion, reeling with the intensity of deep true love fighting the evil forces of human hate and revenge. I would recommend this for any reader who is mature enough to handle the language and themes of forbidden love with acceptance and understanding. It's a fantastic book. I cherish my hardbound copy!\", \"Par Lagerkvist tells the story of Barabbas, the most minor of characters in the New Testament, of whom all that is known is that he was a brigand, released to the crowd instead of Jesus of Nazareth and thus making the death of Jesus a certainty.Lagerkvist fills in the story of this man, giving us a haunted character, born of a loveless encounter, bereft of human companionship, perennially alone and seeking to belong somewhere on some level. The tale is told in deceptively simple prose, in the tone of a parable, and despite its length (under 150 pages)manages to cover decades in Barabbas's life and to tell a story that is effective on several levels.Lagerkvist gives us a Barabbas who seeks more than anything else to have faith, to believe in something. That an agnostic chose to write this sad, lovely book about a character in Christian lore is itself a minor literary miracle. I reread this book almost 30 years after encountering it for the first time, for it stayed with me all those years. It still holds up. It is a book that may haunt you, but there is nothing wrong with that.\", 'Belinda Sampson,This has got to be one of the best books I have read about a child that grows into a woman with so much courage and determination in her character no matter what was put upon her shoulders. Mother to the famous Stevie Wonder or not, this woman is an inspiration within herself for all of the pain she has went through. The book speaks of a hard life, a hard childhood like that of Nightmares Echo-a memoir. It also reminds me of a couple of other books such as A Child Called It and Running With Scissors. I am just in utter amazement with this book. Pride shines in my eyes along ith the tears I shed while reading this wonderful book.', \"Shane is one of the better westerns I've read.

      "[\"The book begins with Lennie and George: Lennie being an oversized mamoth of a man--Goliath--in a way, and George being your man of an average size. The roll between the two is that they both have the same dream and that is to live off the fat of the land and raise rabbits. Lennie, is best put as retarded, but is really the nicest guy in the world: it is just his size that interfears with the two men's lives. George has a short fussed temper and Lennie can't help but be dumb when it comes to any situation they may find themsleves in. The book has a great plot that you have to stop and think about long after you have put the book down, and this is without a doubt, the most realistic novel I have ever read. I would suggest reading this at a MATURE high school level. If you are too young for this book, you will not understand it. If you do understand it, you will see what a great novel it really is.\", 'The Awakening:If you think that women should do everything what their husband tell them to do, you probably won`t like &quot;The Awakening&quot;. Anyway, I would encourage you to read this book, because you will find much more than a simple love story and I`m sure you will change your way of thinking about this kind of subject. I personally liked the book because of the way I got envolved with the story. I found a new point of view for everything in close relation with women emancipation. I wonder what would have happened if &quot;The Awakening&quot; had never dissapeared from the bookshops as it did for more than fifty years. I think that many things would be totally different, beginning in our society. I would really like you to read the book, to help me find out how it affected our society.Verena Salomon', 'I think that I will finally give up reading this series. The plot has started to move like a herd of stampeding turtles running in molasses.I was totally disappointed with this book, it did nothing for me but fill my spare time with wasted time. I will always enjoy reading books 1 through 5 but this is getting out of hand. It just drags and drags and drags, getting no where. I would suggest waiting for the Cliff Notes for this one.', 'To be the fourth reviewer for a play originating in 1998 and published first in 2003, from America\\'s greatest living (read: accomplished, awarded, distinguished, scathing, etc.) playwright seems, well, somehow to mark the state of theatre, play going and play reading very clearly.This is a horror play, a mind-messing, unprovoked rape of the sensibility and energy of youth and reason. Where any abundance of joy and hope is dashed first, then exposed, if lucky.Boy and Girl are newly-weds, and she is pregnant opening the story. Girl gives birth, and as casually as that they are parents. Man and Woman are here too. Expounding on the oddities and ironies of life, they cease any theatrical construct and refer to the audience at will, inviting us in to what becomes and experiment, or an exorcism.Like Nick and Honey in Who\\'s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, Boy and Girl are taken on a ride by Man and Woman, brought into the open, exposed and scarred (\"Wounds, children, wounds. Learn from it. Without wounds, what are you? If you don\\'t have a broken heart...\"), to perhaps be made even more whole, as they are forced to shed their skin of simple beauty, joy and love.If the \"whole thing\" is really about the \"baby,\" meaning survival and procreation, the simple yet vital act we are obsessed with, in order to keep going is here eviscerated. The commercial love and joy of parenthood picked on and torn, the easy-in-easy-out given as shallow, and the true rites of passage amidst life are shown to be the knowledge of damage, hurt, abandonment, falsity, lies.Brilliant Albee.', \"This book is a great idea for New Testament Greek newbies like myself; I must say, however, that the strange, italicized font the publisher chose is a terrible choice. It's very difficult to read and takes some time to get used to certain of the letters. I can not, understand why they would do this. The actual Tanakh quotes appear in normal, upright typeface (in bold) and how I wish the rest of the text was like this. The good thing about this book is it really encouraged me to get off my rump and learn the vocab down to a much lower frequency level so I don't have to use it any more.Pages have nice gold bible trim but there is no leaf page marker attached, but it's hard to complain too much when the thing is so inexpensive. Did I mention the terrible font choice?I hope the new version coming out in August, 2007 remedies this problem.OK, here's my updated review for the 2nd edition of this book. I purchased the second version which came out in 2007.It now *does* include a leaf page marker, but they still use the same horrible font.It's like they are trying to confuse the reader.It's really just too bad. I get the feeling some bigwig at the publisher invented this font so nobody wants to change it completely so as not to offend someone but please, please, use a normal Greek font like every other Greek bible I've ever seen.This item is for students, not masters, so why try to be different than all the rest? This is definitely one instance where conformity would be appreciated.I broke down and bought the UBS Reader's Greek New Testament (a competing product).It is much better for reading. The nice thing about this one by Zondervon is it's size. It's very very thin, whereas the UBS product is as thick and heavy as my Hebrew Reader's Old Testament.In summary, the font is terrible. The paper and cover are nice, and the bible leaf is handy. If you're gonna sit at a desk and not tote the thing around get the UBS version instead. If you like to travel light, get this one.I will not buy the 3rd edition unless they use a totally different and standard Greek font.\", \"A Prayer For Owen Meany is the BEST book I have ever read. It leaves all other books in the dust! It is so complicated and intricate. You could read this book over and over again and still catch something new that you didn't the first time you read it. Throughout the book you will smile, you will frown, you will laugh, and you will cry. For six-hundred pages of words there is so much depth to this book. In every situation in the book there is something to think about and learn about. It is so dense. At the end of the book, you want more. You want it to go on forever. Anyone who likes stories about life, will love this book!\", 'Mrs. Dalloway is, of course, a classic novel and a great read. But enough time has passed that an annotated edition is useful.

I would also like to see a good edition like this available for the Kindle.', \"I can't say enough good things about this book. In ON BEAR MOUNTAIN, Deborah Smith gives us unforgettable characters in an irresistible setting, all bound together by an inextricable sense of destiny. She does destiny nearly as well as John Irving, but her voice is all her own--uniquely Southern, by turns gritty and gentle, soft and sassy, and etched with a tender irony that can make you laugh out loud or break your heart. She writes with genuine emotion and sentiment, but never stoops to manipulative sentimentality. Like her protagonist, Quentin Rinconni, she is a brilliant and sensitive artist who can instinctively find and give meaning to the complex patterns that define even the most ordinary of lives. Bravo, Ms. Smith, and thanks for another extraordinary read!\", \"Enjoyed the BBC production of this, so rushed out to get the books in the series. This is the first of four (so far). It takes you up to the summer of 1938, before the war. There's a tremendous amount about all the kids, which sometimes becomes tedious if you're more into the adults' world. But it's hard to not get caught up in the world that Elizabeth Jane Howard creates here - she delivers so much compelling detail that you feel like you're there.\", 'book arrived quickly and largely in good shape. there was a bit of water damage to the book that seemed odd, and the seller was willing to refund my money if necessary. it was a gift, and she decided to keep it, but still good to know that we could have been refunded if necessary.overall, a great transaction!thanks!', \"This book was specifically required by my daughter's 8th grade English teacher, in the version obtained from Amazon.

I'd recommend this version of the story to all readers.\", \"1984 is certainly a good book which fully explores this fascinating society. Winston's struggle was interesting, but it was the way this society was constructed that truly made this book great. I would encourage everyone to read it. The book starts off very slow, a little too slow for my taste, which is why I gave it four stars instead of five. Once it gets going, though, the book is truly engrossing. I was unable to put it down until the end.\", 'I found the book invaluable, almost inspirational in its zeal to encourage good writing on the &quot;micro&quot; rather than the &quot;macro&quot; level.

Guy Sajer writes as only someone who was there can. It is an honest account of the brutality commited by both sides. Very honest in its descriptions. Fans of the German-Russo war will enjoy.

It turned out to not be the book I needed but that was my own fault', \"This book was a required reading for university. I was not quite certain what to think.....that is until I started to get into the book. This novel is a delightful and intriguing romantic comedy. The pride of Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett's prejudice against him are overcome as they learn that love can and does conquer. Elizabeth was a character I could relate to. She was not afraid to stand up for herself and overcame conventions, like walking through mud to see her sick sister, Jane!Perhaps I am not the most qualified to write a review of Jane Austen's work, but I know what I like. This book had me laughing from beginning to end. With Mr. Collins' &quot;speeches&quot; and Mrs. Bennett desperately trying to marry off all her daughter's, who can help themselves? I am now hooked on Jane Austen because of this one book. Read it and experience it for yourself.\", 'good book, needs overall measurements in diagrams, square footage of first floor not always easy to determine', \"Excellent book and even more rewarding was the condition of the book!

The book is a little out of date with the financial information. But still very useful anyway.', \"The Easy chronicles have been going along at a good, if at times leisurely clip, when Mosley offers up this scorching instant classic. The portrait of Watts in the aftermath of the riots unleashes something in Easy (and the author) and each page offers insight, anger and great writing. As always the supporting characters who populate the story are richly drawn in little strokes, but for maybe the first time in the series we get a potent villain. And while the historical context of the book is powerful, it never overwhelms the plot which is a high tension grabber. These days it seems Mosley isn't as in vogue as when he debuted, and I'm not sure this book got the critical praise lavished (justly) on peers like Lehane and Pelicanos. But this is as good as it gets and stands as a masterpiece of American fiction, crime or otherwise.\"]\n",

Lennie is a mentally unstable grown man, who acts like a child but has amazing strength-which inadvertantly gets him into trouble. After a misinterperated mishap in Weed, Lennie and George escape to avoid being lynched. They are left a long distance from their work after the driver of the bus on which they were travelling tells them that the distance is not far. Here is where we learn about Lennie's dream of living in their own house... which, at this point, is only a made up story to keep Lennie busy. The next morning, they travel to a working ranch, where they meet Slim, who is not the boss but seems to have the upper hand among the men, Candy, an old worker, Crooks, who works and is forced to live in the stables, and is mistreated because of the color of his skin, and Curley, a pugnacious character who also happens to be the boss's son. After a while, George begins to believe that the dream of owning a house could be possible, seeing how Candy offers to help to avoid being canned.

Ross West has the hard won experience and spiritual depth needed to really be a guide to many of us in this challenging area. He addresses many areas such as responding to unethical situations and seeing spiritual value in our work/in others. He establishes a useful theology of why we work and what our work means and then proceeds to show many practical examples of how that theology can be applied in everyday work-a-day life. One of my favorite parts of the book is the simple but profound observation that we can and should view our work, no matter what it is, as ultimately helping another person somewhere. It's hard to think of a job where this is not the case and even though my technology job is somewhat removed from people directly, it does help them elsewhere. The book caused me to reflect on my work in constructive ways after years of confusion on this topic. I have already recommended the book to some close Christian friends who have the same challenges. It is not easy to find books that are as theologically sound and practical as this one. I am starting to read William E. Diehl who has also written in this area.\", 'First let me start by saying I do not read fiction. Let me add to that that my wife does not read fiction. But one day I saw the cover of Butterscotch Blues and the cover art caught my attention so I picked the book up for a gift. Well the person already had the books so I kept it on the coffee table. While watching TV I casually picked it up and I was hooked from the first page. So naturally I wanted to see what happend next to Sandy, Martha, Britney and especially Janice (who acts and talks just like my sister who happens to have the same name) and I was not disappointed.To me these four sister interact just like the cast of Sex In The City, but they talk about issues with much more substance.Margaret Johnson Hodge paints New York City with the vivid strokes of a master. In actuality NYC is the fifth character in the novel. The sounds the smells the tastes are all in there. But most of all she takes a serious issue and shows it from different, interesting yet realistic points of views.What if you tragically lost your soul mate? What if you found love again and it was perfect? And what if this love just happend to be the brother of your first true love? Like I said its complex.Thank you MJH for a wonderful story that does not DOG men and shows a realistic view of relationships.Still not a true fan of fiction. . . but a TRUE fan of Margaret Johnson-HodgeSugar Man', \"Most satisfying sequel to Carrie's Story.

I just am so fond of the two.\", 'I thought James Luceno\\'sAgents of Chaos I: Hero\\'s Trialwas a wonderful addition to the New Jedi Order series that took us back to Han\\'s rough-and-tumble past.Agents of Chaos II: Jedi Eclipseisn\\'t so much a sequel as a continuation of the series\\' overarching Yuuzhan Vong invasion. This time, the New Republic recruits the Hapans to their cause and try to predict where the Vong will strike next. As a book, it advances the series, but the plot seems a bit too much like an Expanded Universe grab-bag with all of the EU references. We not only see the Hapans, but also Centerpoint Station and droids from the Han Solo trilogy. Meanwhile, Han goes looking for Droma\\'s relatives and, sure enough, finds himself in the middle of the action. Luceno spends a lot of time on these various subplots, but none of them seems gripping in their own right. At times, the plots descend into the \"silliness\" that characterized the later EU books. I thought Anakin\\'s choice at the end was particularly ridiculous. Overall though, there are enough twists to make this a worthwhile entry. The intrigue with the Hutts is great, as is the subplot involving the \"traitor.\" The best part is that Luceno really manages to trick readers and keep them guessing as to the Vong\\'s next target - an admirable trait in a series that too often spoils its surprises. Also, his writing is second to none.', \"Simply delicious! For those folks up in arms about the facts not being quite right (I can't speak to that)or for those people upset about women's roles--please remember to kick back and enjoy a magical book like this and leave your ideology at the door.

Abby adjusts as well as she can but all the while she is desperate for her old life. Abby speaks in believable terms while maintaining the tone of a young teen. My biggest complaint was the use of the present tense, which is a personal pet peeve and not a reflection on the author's style. I loved Abby and my heart broke for her. I know I will be wondering for a long time to come how her life worked out....yes, I know she's fictional but she was brought to life through the author's great sense of writing.

The worst has already occurred. The majority of human life has been destroyed by nuclear warfare before the narrative begins. Only people living in the farthest reaches of the the southern hemisphere remain alive. They too will all be dead in a matter of months as the unstoppable cloud of deadly radiation ultimately covers the entire planet.The novel features a number of Australian characters as well as an American submarine captain. As doomsday approaches, their lives are touchingly described. On the Beach contains some interesting scenarios and there are many moments of poignancy especially in the final pages.Much of the narrative contains accounts of everyday life as the characters strive to go about their business as if the end weren't just around the corner. Since everyday life isn't all that exciting, these portions of the book may be seen as rather dull. It's just very hard to write about the mundaneness of day to day existence without being a little bit boring.All in all, an interesting and thought provoking take on the doomsday novel.

It was clear to our counselor that my stepdaughter was being programmed and brainwashed for the past 14 years by her mother and step-father of 14 years. (I've been in her life for the past 8 years).What I read was very disturbing in that it hit home in so many places. The process and definitions were clear and easily identifiable.The book helped me understand what's been going on and how it happened. In our case the history has been many many years and the programmers'/ brainwashers' support group includes the mother, stepfather, half and step-siblings and grand- parents (among others).I suspect that this behavior is very common in divorce situations (with children) in varying degrees.

I found another book very helpful to lead us through various changes and life situations which was written by Dietmar Scherf and is called 'I Love Me: Avoiding and Overcoming Depression.'\", \"Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs may have made the fragmented plot style popular, but Heller got there first, in this deliciously anarchic look at the madness of war. Heller mixes vivid scenes of slapstick comedy with genuinely shocking incidents without the usual jarring that is found whenever an inexperienced author attempts the same.Heller's real accomplishment is his cast of characters. Most authors just stick with one or two central characters, but Heller gives us a whole battalion of men, each with individual weaknesses and strengths. Also, unlike so many other war stories, this is truly memorable - for years afterwards you'll recall with a smile Milo's impossibly complicated scams, Natley's desperate search for his whore and Yossarian's wry outlook on life.In fact, there are only two problems with this book: firstly, as the book draws to a close, Heller appears to be in a desperate rush to get rid of his characters (presumably so that when Yossarian attempts his final escape, there's not that much tying him back). Secondly, the chapter &quot;The Eternal City&quot; is just awful - it reads like the book Adrian Mole is writing in Sue Townsend's &quot;Adrian Mole: the Wilderness Years&quot; and is so totally depressing it doesn't gel with the rest of the book.Still, two minor glitches in what is surely one of the most superlative books of this or any milennium.\"]\n",

Society's hypersensitivity to the misuse of drugs has only made the problem worse. Finally, one of the country's leading oncologists takes the problem seriously. This book, although designed for clinicians, should be read by every person who must confront pain either in themselves or a friend or relative. Written clearly and compellingly, this book now becomes the authoritative source on this important and overlooked subject. Put another way, any physician who is not familiar with this book simply is not being fair to his or her patients and is not staying current on a central part of current medicine.\", 'Purchased the book to better understand the meanings and was hoping to discover more of the least popular symbols but this book sticks with what is popular.

The good doctor is evidencing increasing paranoia, Lucy is overboard with her anger and Marino needs to shape up and get a woman.', 'John B. Albion has taken on the significant challenge of conjecture for unexplained disappearances of four people in his first thriller/mystery novel, Beyond Fate.With this novel, Albion leads the reader along a new avenue for thrillers. His setting involves Wisconsin, mainly Milwaukee, Port Washington, and northern Wisconsin and Michigan. The Midwest has found its outlet as an intriguing location through this novel. Rather than guns and sophisticated technology, Albion uses ESP and intuition as tools against the \"bad guys.\" This is refreshing and an opening to inform the readers of these true God-given mysteries of an individual.The main character, Tim Storey (a potential cousin for DeKalb\\'s Dr. Storey?), is a modest Port Washington teacher, who receives intuitive information concerning four missing people: a college student and three commercial fishermen. With his sudden visions, Tom becomes obsessive to find these people.The winding plot takes the reader to a Clam Lake military base in northern Wisconsin where Storey is captured and interrogated. He finds himself involved in a conspiracy, meeting an enigmatic character named Palmer, who teams with Storey to solve the riddle of missing persons. The plot takes on a Mission Impossible flavor with an unknown benefactor to answer monetary problems. After reading Beyond Fate, one will look at the wandering, homeless people and wonder if they, too, have visited Clam Lake.As a reader, I wanted to continue with the novel to learn what lay ahead for Tim Storey. As a writer, I see the novel as a tremendous accomplishment for John B. Albion. Though the writing maturity is just above average, that will improve because Albion is dedicated to his profession. As an editor, I see the first half of the novel contains more intensity and stronger writing than the last half. However, those writing blips are Albion\\'s stepping stones to knowledge all novelists must tread upon. And I foresee Albion writing clearer, crisper future novels.I highly suggest mystery lovers purchase Beyond Fate. It\\'s a good read.Albion drew his plot from two unexplained Wisconsin disappearances in 1998. He includes an epilogue about these. Amber Wilde, the college student, still remains unfound, while the other, a commercial fishing boat operating out of Port Washington, Wisconsin, was eventually located on June 18, 2000, at the bottom of Lake Michigan.

I was also uncomfortable with Mayme relating events she and Katie never witnessed, a plot device not used in previous books. However, the book is still very readable and if you've read the rest of the series, you don't want to miss this book. Katie and Mayme are growing up and it shows.

Although still working in radio, Rick's private investigator career has kicked off with his own organisation Rockin' Vestigations. With a new kitten that has severe sinus problems, Rick is ecstatic to have a new attractive client Lollie Woolfolk, who keeps throwing money his way to find out more and more about her long lost grandfather, his long ago associates and some legendary tapes known as the Blind, Crippled and Crazy Sessions. Rick's ecstation comes to an end after he works out he has been hired to track down victims for a murderer and receives a karate chop from the real Lollie Woolfolk which leaves him briefly unconscious and determined to bring the killer and fake Lollie to justice.Highway 61 resurfaced spent considerably less time than Radio Activity did with Rick in the studio or talking about classic rock albums which means an easier flowing storyline for this sequel which concentrates mostly on the PI side of things. It is by far the least surreal novel Fitzhugh has ever written and therefore the less humorous, but it still has a few surreal characters such as elderly blues players and a dim-witted drug taking killer to keep us entertained along with a funny occurrence between Rick and an ex client at a funeral. You don't need to have read Radio Activity to enjoy Highway 61 Resurfaced and not much of that storyline is given away if you read this novel first.

He is a vacuum cleaner salesman (and not a particularly good one) who becomes increasingly worried about finding the funds to support his 17 yr old daughter's expensive hobbies. He wants to provide for her (and her equine interests - not cheap), but doesn't know how. Out of the blue, he is approached by another Englishman who recruits him to be Her Majesty's agent in Havana. They seal the deal in a public toilet. Wormold will get $300 per month plus expenses, and he needs to go out and recruit other agents and informants. The only problem is that he doesn't have the foggiest idea how to find any information that may be of interest. He does want any enterprising spy does - he just starts to make things up. Massive construction of a mysterious base in a remote mountain are of Cuba, detailed technical plans to a new super-weapon that is simply a drawing of his newest vacuum cleaner, etc. He claims to have recruited several agents, none of who he has actually met. All goes well (and Wormold regularly collects his paycheck), until London becomes intrigued and decides to send some help. Suddenly, one of his 'agents' is killed, and several others threatened, and Wormold is suddenly playing spy for real . . .This story is a humorous spoof of spy thrillers. Definitely lots of laughs throughout, but I'd have to say not uniquely outstanding. Makes all the spies and spy games look like Keystone Kops! The ending is particularly well done. I've only read one other novel by Greene (Stamboul Train), so I'm not positioned to characterize this relative to his other works, but this is an entertaining and easy read by one of the 20th century's greatest novelists.\", \"Too many characters. Few of them really memorable. Hamilton doesn't describe them physically so they all run together. I had to write a chart in the front flap of the book to try to keep them straight.

Hamilton has done better.\", 'Having been slightly bored by \"Silas Marner,\" I was not expecting much gratification from this massive tome. But I had heard good things about \"Middlemarch\" from others, so I steeled myself and dug in. I was quite figuratively blown-away by the quality of writing.It is not just that Eliot is an excellent satirist, but that she makes penetrating psychological insights and crafts very well-developed, imminently human characters, who are sympathetic despite their faults. She also exhibits a brilliant mastery of the English language, describing both internal and external scenes in the most beautiful of terms.\"Middlemarch\" is not an easy read; there are multiple characters with complex relationships to one another, and the threads of their singular lives are eventually thoroughly tied up into one another. I found that keeping note cards on the family trees of the various characters was of assistance when reading. But once you have established who everyone is, the complexity of the novel is no longer a hindrance, and it may be read as lightly and quickly as any work of fiction.The plot line is interesting enough, but it is the personalities of the characters that are truly gripping. I cannot recall a single novel that has stimulated my intellect as deeply, or drawn upon my emotions as expertly, or commanded my respect as fully as \"Middlemarch.\" I cannot issue a higher recommendation.', 'I am a big fan of Gwen Marston. She is totally irreverant when it comes to quilters\\' rules. However you shouldn\\'t think that she has no rules at all. If you purchase this book believing it\\'s all just a piece of cake you\\'d be wrong. Making the basic \"string\" fabric is extremely simple, then you follow her patterns for making the blocks using this fabric. A couple of her blocks even have set-in seams which are not all that easy. A bit of quiltmaking expertise is required. But then there are the blocks like Amish Rectangular String, Arkansas Traveler, and Slanted Bars which are very simple and go together quickly.

The descriptions of the merry pranksters are wildly perfect. Thank you! Plus the product arrived on time and was as described.', 'I just finished reading the wonderful book: \"Letters to a Young Catholic,\" and I wanted to express how much I enjoyed it. The book is a masterpiece, and, quite frankly, I couldn\\'t put it down.On a superficial level, I enjoyed having so many \"Catholic words\" jarred from the recesses of my memory, some of which I hadn\\'t thought of in over forty years. I\\'m talking about words like: lauds, compline, viaticum, oblation, preconciliar, oculus, plenary, monstrance, crucifer, chasuble, surplice, ciborium,paten, scavi, unction, aedicule, omphalos, cenotaph, cenacle, cardinalate, and laudation.Not only that, but for the past few days I\\'ve been humming to myself \"Tantum Ergo\" for the first time since, I\\'d guess, about the third grade, and the words are actually coming back to me! Even some of my old altar boy Latin is stating to come back: \"Ad Deum qui laetificat, juventutem meam...\"But on a much deeper level the book is important because it illustrates very dramatically and profoundly the \"Catholic\" worldview, as distinct from even the \"Christian\" worldview and certainly from any \"secular\" worldviews.I want to thank Mr. Weigel for writing the definitive, must-read book for all Catholics. I will be recommending it to all my Catholic friends and relatives. By the way, the section of Chesterton is magnificent and well worth the price of the book itself. I hope Mr. Weigel will strongly consider for his next book an exposition of the major writings of Chesterton - making Chesterton accessible to the lay public.', \"I can't begin to say how much I loved this book and how I regret that it had to come to an end.

Not only does this book bring up several things that are problems in society, but it also make you think about your world and what life would be like with or without certain things or things. Jonas and Gabriel are two of the most lovable characters and every reader is sure to fall in love with them. This book is one of those books that can be read over and over again and each time the reader can get something new and different out of it. Lastly, The Giver is also a book that can be read at almost any age and if you read it more than once at different ages you will view the book differently.K.M.GHS', \"This book makes history come alive.

One part will make you cry.\", 'Great book for new and well experienced Freemasons and also for their spouses and friends to learn why their friend/loved one enjoys the Craft so much!', \"&quot;Fools Die&quot; is one of the most well written books that I have ever read. The words fit together to create an amazing story. This books proves that Mario Puzo does not need to write a story about the mafia to remain America's favorite storyteller.&quot;Fools Die&quot; is set in Las Vegas. It deals with four friends who all meet in Las Vegas. Jordan traveled to Las Vegas to escape his homelife where his wife was leaving him. Merlyn &quot;The Magician&quot; went to Las Vegas to take a break and relax. Cully worked for the casino and overlooked the casino floor. Diane was a hooker for the casino. The book starts with one night, Jordan starts a lucky streak. By the end of the night, he obtained over $400,000. While his three other friends made arrangements for Jordan to leave the city, Jordan pulled out a gun that he had brought, and killed himself.The book continues with telling stories about Cully and Merlyn. It shows their struggles, and how they start to recieve power. Cully becomes the casino manager's right hand man, but eventually decieves him to gain more power. Merlyn gets a job enlisting people into the six-month army reserve program. He becomes a crook by accepting bribes for people who are low on the list and do not want to become drafted into the army. By taking the bribes, Merlyn moves the people up on the list. Eventually, the FBI catches onto the scheme, and investigates. Merlyn, now a very wealthy man, quits his job.Many other great characters are met during the book, especially the world famous author Osano, whom Merlyn starts to work for.This book works on many levels. It is romance, thriller, crime, and dark comedy all rolled into one great book. Mario Puzo's genious work should be read by every person, because it will appeal to all. I hope you all read this book.To read more books by Mario Puzo, read &quot;The Godfather&quot;, and &quot;The Last Don&quot;. Both books are excellent, just as good as &quot;Fools Die&quot;.\", 'The author really has a way with words. This is my second read . First time was hard cover a few years ago.

There are ranchers, miners, town\\'s folk, the gunman, the innocent victim, romance, greed, and more. Dale Rogan, range detective, wants to begin life anew by having his own spread, but walks into a hornet\\'s nest; the local ranchers and the miners are in a fight over water that has poisoned the cattle, and neither side will back down. Dale has no wish to become involved, but he has no choice when the ranchers won\\'t move their cattle from his range, nor the miners who blame him for stealing a shipment of gold bullion. To complicate matters he falls in love with Mae Simms and he promises her he will not shoot another man, as she has learned of his infamous reputation.

I got a little bored during some of the parts where the story shifted to David and Cyn plotting, but it never lasted long. I enjoyed all the different character's outlook on how love works and also the characters were all well wrote. I'm a sucker for fairy tales, so I loved that it was kind of wrote out to be a modern one. I'll more than likely be picking up another book by Crusie soon.\"]\n",

This was the last Vonnegut novel I hadn\\'t read, and it was definitely a great summary of themes and beliefs he expresses in his other novels.To that end, I wouldn\\'t recommend it as a first Vonnegut read. It\\'s almost an essay about his views on the madness of capitalism in America.It\\'s a great novel, no doubt, with a very satisfying ending. But if you\\'ve heard about Kurt Vonnegut and you just want to try it out, try \"Slaughterhouse Five,\" \"Hocus Pocus,\" \"Cat\\'s Cradle,\" or \"Mother Night.\"You really can\\'t go wrong with this amazing author, but \"God Bless You Mr. Rosewater\" might come off as a bit preachy if you don\\'t know what you\\'re getting into.That being said, it is still a great novel. So if you\\'re a fan, read this book.', \"I have attempted to read the 1st book in this trilogy on about 5 occasions over the past 15 years and I never get beyond the Council of Elrond before I yet again find the whole thing too boring to continue.I loved The Hobbit and admire Tolkiens vivid imagination, but his style of writing in LOTR is just too &quot;early 20th century british&quot; for my liking. I have the same problem with Dickens that I do with Tolkien; ponderous prose! I guess I've been spoiled by many of the excellent sci-fi/fanatsy authors (i.e. George R R Martin) that write edge of the seat, gripping &amp; fascinating stories.Unfortunately, in LOTR, Tolkien's ability to tell an interesting tale seems to have taken a backseat to his world building.\", 'I had an awful Con Law professor. He was brilliant and expected students to have a strong historical background.

Tolkien\\'s first claim to fame, but it is better known as the precursor to the famed Lord of the Rings series. It is a story of struggles, adventures, and unlikely heroes in a land called \"Middle Earth\".Hobbits do not like adventures, as the famed Bilbo Baggins once said of adventures, \"Nasty disturbing uncomfortable things! Make you late for dinner!\" With the help of the far more important, but less noted wizard Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins (the hobbit) does in fact set out upon an adventure with thirteen Dwarves to return to Lonely Mountain and regain their treasure, in so defeating the cruel dragon, Smaug.They out wit orcs and goblins, battle spiders and evade elves, Bilbo finds the Ring, yes the Ring, and out riddles the morose Gollum to keep it. They achieve many things, making many friends and even more enemies before reaching old Smaug and the Lonely Mountain, and still they know not what to do about it\\'s treachery.The Hobbit was definitely not a stroke of genius, but a work of genius after years and years of writing lore on goblins, elves, dragons, dwarves, and such, such is all the great things you may have or may yet come to love in Tolkien\\'s writing. The Hobbit however, is a first in Tolkiens lore, and The Hobbit was the first taste of Tolkien much of the world got. Although over shadowed my the trilogy of the Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit is important in understanding Middle Earth, and it does it in a fun way. It is something you could teach you kids to read with, while still enjoying it yourself.The Hobbit was originally intended to be a before bedtime kids book, and it sends a very potent message to it\\'s intended victim...it doesn\\'t matter who you are, where you come from, or how big you are, even the smallest can change the world. To more extent, hopefully we are, in the end, better off, but that is a matter of opinion, for greed is the bleeder of wealth, and happiness can be found in small things, even after big adventures. I did find Tolkien\\'s style rather youthful and informative allowing me to see far in advance the come of events...nonetheless he did an excellent job in portraying the turn of events that was and is The Hobbit. His imagery and imagination are unrivalled, yes, even to those of us who saw the movie first. For those of you who don\\'t like Old English, don\\'t worry, it\\'s hardly used in The Hobbit. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to know more about the Lord of the Rings, or simple wants a good book to read to the young ones before the lights are turned out. Further more I expect you\\'ll get hooked on Middle Earth, so I suggest finding a copy of the Lord of the Rings, because lets face it, for those of us with an imagination, the books are way better.', 'Shaker: Life, Work and Art is a beautiful book. I first saw acopy several years ago and was disappointed to learn that thehardcover version was out of print. The book has short narrative sections that provide insight into Shaker history, work, and communal and spiritual life. One section captures a &quot;typical&quot; day in the life of the Brethren and Sisters. The enlarged font is easy on the eyes and the top of each narrative page is headed by the famous Shaker wall pegs. The narrative sections are separated by numerous pages of high quality, well-captioned color photographs of Shaker crafts, furniture, and architecture. Lots of beautiful pictures! The Shakers legacy still seems to have a profound impact on our contemporary lives in spite of (or perhaps because of) the simplicity of their work and their unusual communal way of life. Although this book does not present a comprehensive history of the Shakers, it does an admirable job of providing an insight into the lives of these interesting people. This book is deserving of any coffee table and should get a lot of attention in your household. END', \"The storyline is promising: a nearly bankrupt commodities trader concocts a scheme to manipulate the emerging coffee commodity in order to repay his debts, but has to outwit a powerful trader who is also his sworn enemy. But 200 pages in, it still felt like a failed promise. I was angry. I was frustrated. I was surprised--surprised his editor let this get out. This is my first book by Liss. Knowing that he'd won a book award and having read the promising first pages, I believed I'd found a well-written book. At the micro level the book is well written in that Mr. Liss has a polished, almost literary writing style. But, at the macro level, the storyline falls short. Reading it was like listening to someone who talks on and on without ever getting to the point. Or like hearing someone try to tell a joke, but they never quite get to the punch line. You could read Ch. 1-3 (53 pages), jump to Ch. 5-6 (13 pages), then jump to Ch. 32 -35 (33 pages) and enjoy all this book has to offer. You could read those 99 pages instead of the entire 386 pages and miss very little in the way of plot development. And you'd feel no torture.Most of the story is written in 3rd person, but part of it is in 1st person. The switch from one viewpoint to the other contributed nothing.Every character in the book is unsympathetic. As a reader, I was disappointed with all of them, even the minor ones. The character who elicited empathy in the beginning (Hannah) was by the end just as disgusting as all the others. BTW, the whole Hannah story contributed little to the main storyline.When I read this book, I almost put it down many times. But David Liss kept stringing me along until, finally at page 200, I couldn't stand another minute of it. So I did something I just don't do: I jumped to the last chapter and read it. Then I read the chapter before that. I began to read it backward one chapter at a time. That made it a lot more interesting. Eventually, the whole book was finished.After this, I would be disinclined to read anything else by David Liss. But I WILL give Liss another chance to redeem himself because he did, after all, manage to string me along for 200 pages.\", \"If I could go back and time and tell high school me to actually read this book for class instead of ignoring it and assuming it must have been bad... Ah...The fact is that Gatsby deserves its consideration as a Great American Novel. It's fascinating in language, story, and scope (as well as, you know, meaning), and it's like as American as possible. Unlike many other modernist American novels, it actually explores America in America from an American perspective. Like, it doesn't take place in Europe and it isn't about America compared to Europe. It is actually able to comment on American aristocracy as it is because of this, not as it is in comparison to other societies. So, seriously on the 'America' part of 'Great American Novel' is what I mean.I actually feel hesitant to write a review on it. Everything that needs to be said about The Great Gatsby is is the book. Everything I could write has been explained better by Fitzgerald. This is by no means a bad thing (check out my rating, come on), and in fact it's a great achievement. Fitzgerald managed to embody the modernist idea of an artwork that stands for itself, by no means an easy task.

I was 11 when I read Jane Eyre for a school book report of our choosing and was the first \"real\" book I ever read.

There arenot any instances, in which, the action of the story isseems out of place or stuck in for shock value. Theauthor weaves a delicate tapestry that has a connectionwith other parts of the novel presented beforehand. Thisnovel is a wonderful piece of writing the charactersfound within the novel are not perfect, they are veryhuman indeed. The reader may find himself sympathizingand hating the character in the span of a few pageswhich can be attributed to the excellent characterdevelopment. I found my moods corresponding to thechapter I was reading in the novel. This, I feel,is effective writing. This is a first rate novel,which may not be the most palatable of reading for mostmen, but being a man myself I can still find this novelrelevant with men. I feel that if males read this novelit would help them understand the female psyche, bulimia,and just what do some women want. Females would probablybenefit the most, because the novel hits close to homewith most of the women I knew. I have recommended thisbook to many of my female friends.

The story includes Poirot\\'s friend the mystery author Ariadne Oliver ( who bears a close resemblance to Agatha Christie).The book is narrated in the third person. It is always delicious fun when Poirot and Oliver join wits to defeat crime!Plot: Ariadne Oliver the famous crime novelist is attending a literary party. She meets the obesely odious Mrs Burton-Cox.

Fee was a wealthy actress who has died leaving a large fortune to DesmondBurton-Cox wants Ariadne to investigate Celia\\' background. It is believed that Miss Ravencroft\\'s parents committed suicide. Another theory is that Celia\\'s father Sir Alistair Ravenscroft killed his much younger wife Molly or she murdered him. The murderer was then believed to have killed him/herself The unsolved case occurred some fifteen years prior to the novel\\'s action.Ariadne refers to persons who worked or were otherwise acquainted with the deceased Ravenscroft couple as old elephants. This is because Oliver hopes those she interviews have good memories like elephants! Ariadne and her friend Hercule Poirot visit these characters hoping to learn more details about the murder/suicide. We learn of the romantic triangle involving Sir Ravenscroft and the twin sisters Molly and Dolly. Dolly has spent time in a mental institution. She was living with her sister and Sir Alistair at the time of the tragic deaths. Dolly is thought to have murdered a child in India as well as her son. Four wigs and a dog bite will clarify the crime.Though a very late Hercule Poirot novel I thought this entry in the Christie canon provides a good read.

About one quarter of the Earth's population is Muslim and a high percentage of them blame the U.S. for just about everything. Unfortunately, according to polls, about 25% of American Muslims feel the same way. So the book was both timely and interesting. But it was also very poorly written. The grammar was atrocious. As for the story, one thing that really bothered me was that basically all of the government officials from the President on down kept referring to the terrorists as ARAB Muslims. In reality, less than 15% of Muslims are Arab. Pakistanis are NOT Arabs. Indonesians are NOT Arabs. Iranians are NOT Arabs. Chechans are NOT Arabs. Somalis are NOT Arabs. Nigerians are NOT Arabs. And yet all of these groups have their share of terrorists. Another thing that bothered me is that according to the story there were about 20,000 Muslims who had been placed in the U.S. over the last twenty years to live peaceful American lives, raising families, holding down jobs, making friends and not attending radical mosques and yet NONE of them switched sides. If the number had been twenty instead of twenty thousand I might be able to accept it.

I read it for the first time two years ago and have since re-read it once every couple of months. The age difference between the characters is handled so well that I felt it enhanced the love story rather than detract from it. So many romance novels portray marriages with large age gaps as horrific ones in which wives suffered abuse, neglect, oppression or worse. It was refreshing to see a novel that positively portrayed what was an inescapable historical reality for the eighteenth century. Brava Ms. Feather!

It is not a light read but a wonderfully touching one that reminds me, particularly after reading one of Ms.Feather's more current 'light' novels, why I love the author enough to buy her with no additional endorsment but the name Jane Feather on the cover.\", \"Hard to believe I read the same book these reviewers are trashing. It's far more complex and sympathetic on all sides, not sentimental but challenging (maybe that's the problem)and unwilling to accept easy stereotypes.

Despite the foreshadowing of brautigan's abandoning of modern American society (He's out in the mountains of Idaho as we speak, putting his mack on some female hikers or else shivering alone in a bear's cave), this book also is funny.

One think I am sure is that with this book, that is rather long and difficult to understand at some points, you may be tempted to call it quits time and again, but I suggest to go all the way to the end, as it is worth reading it all.

The individual stories, taking place at certain times, are magnificent. The story takes place at the time of the Belgian Congo and I wish we had a little more history in the story, but then again, that's not what this novel was about. It was about the family dynamics and what each and every one of them learned from their experiences in the Congo at this particular time and how it affected their lives and those around them.

I've read many books on the banking system, politics, the control big business has over the government, the cause & effect of wars, but this book incorporates them all, and makes it crystal clear of who's really pulling the strings, and why there is so much unnecessary strife, conflict, hostility, pain & suffering throughout the world today.The author most certainly has the qualifications to write this book, as he was an economic hit man for over 20 years, until his conscience got the best of him. He names many of the mega corporations and their CEOs that are pulling the strings that are causing all the wars, all for the sake of a higher profit margin.I thoroughly checked out many of his footnotes for accuracy online, and was able to establish the authenticity of all of the facts throughout the book.I just stumbled across this book in a bookstore, and was very surprised it is not receiving worldwide attention! It should be mandatory reading before a person is even allowed to vote. It should be taught in schools, and it shoud be a criteria for all international reporters to read this book.John Perkins not only clarifies the causes of all the wars, poverty, and the reason there's so much hatred of the American empire throughout the world, he offers many very logical solutions.By far one of the best books I have ever read, and I am an avid reader.\", 'I felt at times like the author was pulling out his thesaurus to make the book sound more \"scholarly\".

The stream of conciousness style is incredably evocative and draws you entirely into Offreds world - not necessarily a place you want to be.

It truely made me wish that I had been born a few generations earlier (not that I didn\\'t already wish that). The first half of the book is a more in-depth account of hippy philosophies, drugs, sex, fashion, activism etc...and the second half of the book serves as more of a list of events, people, places, music, literature etc... which helped to shape the counterculture. I would suggest this book for pleasure reading purposes rather than as a source of refference mostly because it is a biased perspective (the perspective of a true and full-blown hippy) and because the accounts of people and events (all of which are extremely essential to the understanding of the hippie movement) don\\'t go into great detail...rather they are more like extended summaries. However if you are researching the counterculture, you aren\\'t already very familiar with it, and you need a place to start, this book will serve as a great starting point with every aspect of the counterculture nicely summarized and topped off with the thoughts of a true hippie who was there, lived it, loved it, and wants to share it with the world.', \"1) the military is evil, (2) any person in the military is an idiot, and (3) any person who mocks the military is heroicNo, the book doesn;t say this at all. what it does talk about is, amoung others, the stupidity of war and the ballance between indeviduality and duty.Don't foget, the heor of the novel is a Captain in the AF.

Granted, it is not for the fainthearted or the disinterested, but like many great novels requires a certain commitment in order to experience the many benefits that it affords.

For the beginner I would recommend either a guide to middle earth, which can be found on the web or on amazon, or to use wikipedia, this may help with some of the frustration that can come with not knowing the names and places. Tolkien provides a map, and with these tools the reader can begin to appreciate some of the more difficult sections.

These additions are a fascinating addition to Master Waysun Liao\\'s story of Lao Tzu\\'s visit to a border town in China before wandering across the Western mountains toward India. During the visit he reveals the secrets of living in the Tao. Portions of these secrets eventually become the text of the Tao Te Ching.The importance of this story is that it lends context to the enigmatic text of the Tao Te Ching. Without this context, the interpretation of this classic will vary widely. With the context of a story, there is a cohesive vision of the eighty-one chapters of the Tao Te Ching which explain how man may live in harmony with the world and the world unseen.The\"Afterword\" is a conversation with Master Liao about interpreting the Tao Te Ching, religion, and the practice of Taichi today. He expresses a view that is insightful and controversial.Appendix 1 is a direct, character by character translation of the latest scrolls unearthed in 1973. These scrolls are felt to be the earliest record of the Tao Te Ching. This translation is keyed, line by line to references in the story. Thus a student of the enigmatic version of the Tao Te Ching can refer back to the contextual meaning given within Master Liao\\'s story. It truly gives the poetry an enriched meaning.Appendix 2 is the original text, IN CHINESE, of the scrolls. This should be invaluable should an able scholar wish to understand the basis of Master Liao\\'s translation.The third Appendix is a jewel of a glossary of 23 key terms used by Lao Tzu. Not only is the meaning of each term explained, but suggestions are made on how to incorporate the concepts into the reader\\'s meditative practice. For example Master Liao explains how to use breathing techniques to reunite the mind and body. Appendix 3 will inspire many productive meditation sessions, sessions that hopefully will lead the meditator to experience the power of the Tao.The Deluxe Study Edition is definitely worth the additional money. With the study edition, the Tao Te Ching goes way beyond puzzling poetry; it becomes instead a resource for your practice, a practice that can guide you towards a life in harmony with the Tao.', 'Makes me want to go and live in Italy, the new one is called Ripe for the Picking and is available on Amazon.co.uk.']\n",

      "[\"I found this novel exceptionally detailed. The author let you get to know Santiago without writing a complete biography. I especially liked the fact that Hemingway gave a little information about Santiago's previous adventures. The conflict with the sea was a popular subject in the years previous to the writing of this novel. Yet Hemingway introduced his readers to a new side of the sea. Santiago saw the sea as a friend that harbored a brother. The sea gave people food, and was a very peaceful place. This is totally opposite to the sea in Mellville's Moby Dick.

Yoga and magic, core elements of hinduism as well as buddhism, are unfamiliar to him. As a result he does not come to the point which makes the book quite tiresome.\", \"It's amazing to see how many Pierce fans have popped up over the past six or seven years. I remember when she barely wrote a book-- when the Immortals suddenly appeared so many years after Alanna, my private school practically had a festival. Tamora is a talented writer; in the Circle, she's created spectacular characters, realistic personalities. Like most Pierce fanatics, I'm a sucker for her way of dealing with swashbuckling romance-- and I must say that I haven't held any of her villians as dear as I did Roger (I'm also a sucker for bad guys). It's hard to expect that from the Circle, which is a charming read about the science of magic, not the overzealous use of it against the bad guy. These kids are against the odds of nature-- and realistic aspects of life. Reading the books are like going on vacation; Winding Circle sounds like the Mediterranean (spelling?) to me. Everything seems bright. I still have to find out what happens to Briar, but so far Daja's story, I think, is the best of the series. She makes very powerful desisions within it. But the plot is slow in this series; almost everything is taken day by day, and the parts in Daine's books where she mediated (and I almost snoozed) well, sorry, Tamora, but pretty much half the Circle is written like that. I can't really explain it.

This book was a great addition to my quest, and I would recommend it for any family wanting to encourage healthy eating habits and easy recipes.Some features I really liked: there are tips and facts next to almost every recipe which range from what kind of green beans to buy to how to alter the recipe for a toddler. Also almost all of the recipes make two cups of puree, which makes it really easy to freeze or expand for the family. Also there are is a lot of variety when it comes to time involved in cooking. Almost every recipe is easily adaptable to become a family meal. This book really inspires you to skip the hot dogs and tater tots and give your kids a nutritious meal.On the downside some recipes do include items before the recommended age to start. However this is easily adapted by just waiting a few months before using the recipe. My biggest complaint is the lack of information about starting your infant on solids. There is only one page regarding this, no recipes and few details on cereals. I guess since I am currently in that stage it bothers me more than usual.Overall I recommend purchasing this book for the great recipes, but I would still get at least one other book that talks more about the initial stages if you are starting from the beginning. Blender Baby food - why not try it for yourself?', 'Very good author: My advice is to read everything Gennita Low has written. I was not disappointed in any one I read', \"Tired of facile books on eBay? (You know, something like 'Moron's Guide to eBay'.) Are you wavering on going to buy or sell on it, never having done so? Or you are already on eBay. But you are wondering if there are ways to get better prices, where 'better' of course depends on whether you are buying or selling. Well, here is an excellent how-to manual that still keeps some objective distance from its subject. That separation lets the author offer some disinterested advice. You can best see this when Karp evaluates the various listing options available to a seller. His suggestions, especially on one option, which he considers a total waste of money, are excellent.There are some omissions that would have made this a stronger book. He offers 100 tips. But...He discusses Phishing. Which has been used against eBay and Paypal users. But, as far as I can tell, he never uses this term. He REALLY should. We can imagine new users hearing about it, wanting to know more and not finding it in this book's index and hence passing on the book. And phishing is actually more dangerous than just one bad auction.Also, he omits three important tips. Firstly, once you have sold to a satisfied buyer, you should add that buyer to an email list. Next time you offer a similar item, very politely email her about it. (Of course, drop her if she opts out.) You can also add unsuccessful bidders in your auctions to this list, though you may have to go thru eBay's mailer to contact them. He mentions keeping a spreadsheet of your auctions, including the email addresses of your buyers. But he doesn't take the next simple step.Secondly, consider first offering future items directly to previous buyers, instead of listing on eBay. If no takers, then put on eBay. This does NOT violate any eBay rules because the buyer and seller now know each other and can talk about nonlisted items. There have been reports in the media about businesses selling on eBay partly to get just such a list of customers. Of course, there is now no eBay protection for buyer or seller. But if you are a business with a website and a good eBay rating, this reassures buyers. And you, as a seller, have a defacto credit check on buyers, by looking at their ratings.Thirdly, what would have been good is a tip on when it is NOT economic to list an item on eBay. Note that I did not say 'sell'. Amongst some power sellers, there has been increasing dissatisfaction. Prices are falling, eBay raises its fees and more auctions end without any bids. If you have an item for which there is little demand, then what is the chance that within 7 or 10 days of an auction, potential buyers will go to eBay and look for it? Remember, eBay always charges a listing fee. Of course, you can lower your price, to spur demand. But that costs you. At some point, things become uneconomic. In fact, if you have specialised books with a limited audience, Amazon is a viable alternative as it levies no listing fee, albeit with a higher commission if the book actually sells.Karp is a very experienced eBay user and a good programmer. But I really do not think the greatest readership for this book is people who want to or are able to program, and they will not be enamoured by the code examples. I suspect he could have expanded greatly on the points I raised, to the benefit of that readership.\", '\"Meet The Tiger\" (later retitled \"The Saint meets the Tiger\") published in 1928, was Leslie Charteris\\'s first book in the Saint Saga (even though Hodder & Stoughton later pretended thatEnter the Saintwas, presumably because they weren\\'t the publishers of the former).It\\'s a useful (though not infallible) rule of thumb that if a book doesn\\'t hook you by the end of the first page, it\\'s not going to. Here are the first two paragraphs of \"Meet the Tiger\":\\'Baycombe is a village on the North of Devon coast that is so isolated from civilisation that even at the height of the summer holiday season it is neglected by the rush of lean and plump, tall and short, papas, mammas, and infants. Consequently, there was some sort of excuse for a man who had taken up his dwelling there falling into the monotony of regular habits &mdash; even for a man who had only lived there for three days &mdash; even (let the worst be known) for a man so unconventional as Simon Templar.It was not so very long after Simon Templar had settled down in Baycombe that the peacefully sedate village became most unsettled, and things began to happen there that shocked and flabbergasted its peacefully sedate inhabitants, as will be related; but at first Simon Templar found Baycombe as dull as it had been for the last six hundred years.\\'Not the greatest opening Leslie Charteris ever wrote &mdash; he was to become pretty skillful later &mdash; but quite respectable for a young man of 21 in only his third book. The character so introduced, of course, was to become the longest-running fictional hero of the 20th century.Even at this early stage, the Saint (plausibly from his initials &mdash; but you knew that) is a more well-developed, more travelled and certainly more eccentric character than his near-contemporary, Bulldog Drummond. There are few of the wilder parts of the world which he has not visited, and few of those in which he has not had adventures. He has won a gold rush in South Africa, and lost his holding in a poker game twenty-four hours later. He has run guns into China, whisky into the United States and perfume into England. He deserted after a year in the Spanish Foreign Legion (Drummond would have been horrified at the idea of joining, let alone deserting).Likewise Patricia Holm, the Saint\\'s companion in so many later adventures, is a much more interesting heroine than boring little Phyllis Drummond, who exists only to be kidnapped and rescued &mdash; someone whom the swine have got, or might get, and nothing more.The elements of the plot are pretty much the standard stuff of the day: a debonair hero for the reader to identify with; a million dollars in gold stolen from a Chicago bank by a mysterious mastermind known as The Tiger; a gang of ruthless criminals; and of course a damsel in distress. What separates this from the majority of such efforts is the way Charteris plays with these elements &mdash; tongue clearly in cheek, in places &mdash; and weaves a story that carries you along from first to last. Some of the characters (Algy, for instance, or Aunt Agatha) are so skillfully drawn that you feel you\\'d recognise them if they walked into your local pub.Other characters that recur later include Simon\\'s faithful manservant Orace, and &mdash; briefly, inKnight Templar&mdash; Detective Inspector Carn.From what I can make out, \"Meet The Tiger\" is very difficult to get hold of; but if you want to read the Saint books it\\'s worth making the effort. They\\'re definitely best if read in the right order.P.S. For a list of &mdash; and discussion of &mdash; all Charteris\\'s Saint books, see my So You\\'d Like To... Guide.', 'There are far better ways to acquire what this book has to offer. As other reviewers have stated, it is about a handful of people and the way they live their lives, particularly one young man who strays from the beaten path in search of Truth. The occassional snippets of philosophy and theology are smothered between long descriptive passages of rather uninsightful people-watching. If you have a lot of time on your hands, perhaps this book would appeal to you. If you are looking for an interesting or enlightening read, look elsewhere.', 'Ever wanted to re-vist the 80s and relive all the wonderful memories? Or perhaps learn about that time you might be too young to remember? Matthew Rettenmund\\'s \"Totally Awsome 80s\" is the best place to start. At just over 160 pages, it gives you loads of trivia in such areas as important world events, pop music, movies, TV shows, scandals, and other items of interest.The entire book is an easy read, since most areas are broken down into top 10-20 lists, with brief and often humorous commentary from the author. The most amusing section bar none is the \"80sSpeak: The Idioms and Idiocies of 80s speech\", which is an alphabetical dictionary of sorts outlining various 80s slang that was all the rage back them. From the teen slang (\"Rad\", \"Gnarly\", \"Tubular\"), to the annoying valley girl slang (\"Fer Shur\", \"Gag me with a spoon\", \"Spazzing\"), to the sexual innuendos (\"Do The Wild Thing\", \"Get Horizontal\", \"Do The Nasty\"). The list goes on. The book also covered more serious topics, like the greatest historical events (collapse of the Berlin Wall), and the biggest disasters (the AIDS epidemic). Also, for your reading pleasure, there is a look at the trends in fashion and art, which will either have you saying \"Oh, fond memories\" or \"What the @#$% were we thinking?\"The most useful sections are the music and movie chapters. The music chapter has a great list entitled \"The 80 Quintessentially 80s songs\", which has a list of some of the best tracks from the decade - great for people looking to get into the music and who don\\'t know where to start. The movies chapter outlines the best in action, drama, comedy, horror, and the best and worst of the decade. Each is broken down into a top 20 list for easy reference. The commentary from the author, while not overly helpful or informative, is fun to read nonetheless. Matthew Rettenmund has a very sardonic approach to looking at the topics covered, and his commentaries are like those witty captions they have in magazines. After all, this is not a textbook.\"Totally Awsome 80s\" is a fun read that you will likely revisit over and over again, either for the memories or to reference movies and songs listed therein. I\\'m sure there are other books that cover the decade better, but I have yet to find one. Though it is best appreciated by those who experienced the 80s, it is easily accessible to anyone who is interested.', 'This has a great overview of the disease and many, many good suggestions as to how to proceed and what to expect. We are very grateful for this wonderful book.', 'When I got my Kindle I quickly decided that a Vonnegut novel would be the first thing I read, like christening a new ship. \"Cat\\'s Cradle\" is a superb book, and it remains one of my favorites even 30 years after I first read it. This digital edition, however, needs some heavy proofing by a copy editor. In most-- if not all!-- instances, trailing double quote marks do not immediately follow the final letter or punctuation mark. Instead, they are shifted one space to the right and appear before the first letter of the next word. This frequently gives the appearance of a new character speech, when the author intends only narrative. This is compounded by the author\\'s own use of the word \\'Papa\\' in double quotes. The problem is not a deal killer, but it causes the reader to back up and re-read many sentences to get them back into the proper context, thus yanking the reader frequently out of the story being spun.5-star book brought back one star due to a bad digital conversion.', 'So the critics say there are too many coincidences in the book for it to be believable.

Furthermore, it is is an in depth look into the human psyche -- the distances we will go in pursue of love and happiness. It is just a great feeling to find that against all odds (and sometimes it does seem that way in the book) happiness can be obtained.', 'This is a very important book which uncovers and describes in meticulous and uncompromising detail how the Republican administration, together with William Casey\\'s CIA, secretly armed Saddam Hussein with atomic, chemical and nerve agents breaking domestic and international law and then lying about these clandestine activities to the American people.Spider\\'s Web is an outstanding book and one which George Bush Sr might want to read to his \"Fortunate Son\" at bedtime. This just might help the current President gain a clearer understanding and deeper perspective of the historical and illegal trading relationship which created Saddam\\'s huge war machine at a time when he was George Shultz and George Bush Sr\\'s close friend in the Middle East.Why does the American Mainstream Media fail to hold US politicians to account on their past illegal dealings with foreign dictators which Washington helped to create?

The characters were richly developed and the story flowed easily. I found myself really pulling for the characters, especially Luke James. To all of you who are looking for something different, read &quot;Battle Creek.&quot; You won't regret it.\", \"Raymond Carver is my all-time favourite writer. I was hooked on his writings since the first time I read his book, which is this one. When I first finished reading this book some years ago, it changed my view in English literature altogether. What struck me was the stark honesty and reality in his writings. Never had I come across a writer who was as honest as Carver. He tells his stories the way life really is, without trying to twist, sensationalise or glamourise it. He tells stories about people like us. In fact, his stories are about us and the people around us.Don't be fooled by the length of his short stories, his shortest pieces like 'Neighbors' and 'Fat' are among his best (though I can't really point out any that is not his best anyway) because it tells so much in so little words.Another startling thing about Carver's stories is that it can relate to people everywhere in the world though he writes about Americans.\"]\n",

It explains all the history of the beginning, the interludes and the finality of this magnificent universe. It pulls together many histories that were omitted in the recounting of earlier stories. Tolkien's concept of the beginning of the earth surely rivals that of the Bible's Genesis. The only problem found by some readers is that the &quot;accounts&quot; are not necessarily time-sequential; but if you can understand this, the reading will make each reader wizer and more fulfilled by this metaphor of our existance and our dreams.\", \"I really enjoy how Mr. Hillerman threads Native beliefs and traditions into his plots. Even though this isn't my Tribal affiliation, love the information.\", 'I have just spent several days reading \"My Life So Far,\" and that\\'s what it will take to get to know the real Jane Fonda through her own eyes and this effort. This is a long book, an autobiography packed with detail covering every phase of her life. It is written in an easy, readable voice and from this reviewer\\'s perspective, comes straight from the heart. I defy anyone not to call the willingness to portray one\\'s innermost feelings and experiences--both controversial and mainstream--a brave act.Jane Fonda didn\\'t ask to be born into the glare of the public eye, but rather she was thrust there by means of a famous father who was emotionally unavailable. Further, she faced painful, everyday esteem issues and her mother\\'s suicide while the world watched and judged. She suffered from bulimia, and what she describes later in the book (through the words of Oprah Winfrey), \"the disease to please.\" Some can and have called it whining, however, in a memoir it is more accurately described as self-study and portrayal. In the end Fonda learns to \"inhabit herself.\" You don\\'t have to like her to read this book. If you enjoy reading memoirs of fascinating people, this one fills the bill.Reading this book allows one to contemplate many life issues. I thought about my own parents and siblings; growing up and fitting in; first sexual experiences; friendships; exercise; marriage; childbirth; religion; social work and my attitude towards the Viet Nam war. (Her trip to Hanoi and the aftermath--so sensationalized and misconstrued--unfolds with interesting detail and explains her motivations in a riveting fashion). But what I found particularly interesting was her insider\\'s perspective to making movies. I always wondered how actors could pull off love scenes and Fonda gives the emotional and physical details of one of her most important and noted love scenes, with Jon Voigt in \"Coming Home.\"Her second act is by far the most interesting. By the time Ted Turner comes into the picture, I couldn\\'t help but wonder how, given everything she had revealed thus far, she could have fallen for such a man. She gave up her movie career--not necessarily because of him but because she was ready to retire--and adopted another new role dedicating her time to various social causes including the important issue of population stabilization and the foundation of G-CAPP (Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention). I think ultimately the third act depicts an extremely ambitious, motivated and generous chameleon of a woman who has never hesitated to stop learning about herself and the world.One error that really jumped out is when Fonda attributes the quote describing Oakland, CA, \"There is no there, there,\" to Dorothy Parker, when the quote actually came from Gertrude Stein. While not serious enough to undermine her credibility, her editor may want to give that a second look.Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I\\'d Said.', 'A story of a segment of humanity who have a commitment which confirms their identity as human beings in a global landscape.

A mark in history which we will remember.', \"I received this book as a 'gift' from the CEO of the small software company I worked for several years ago. (As did everyone else working there) The only good thing I can say about it is that it's short, which makes it easier to choke down its vapid aphorisms and do-as-you're-told attitude.

But in 'The Martian Chronicles', a somewhat loose collection of short stories involving humans (from Earth) colonizing Mars, this reader was left wanting for something insightful or special. Instead I found this collection of stories to be very readable, at times interesting, but also at times rather bland. And at no time did I sense this book deserved to be considered a classic. This would be an insult to its author who has indeed written classics (eg, 'Fahrenheit 451').Bottom line: a somewhat forgettable book that seems to have garnered more readership than it deserves. A near miss.\", \"Transformative Love is an easy read and well worth it. My concept of Love was challenged and broadened by reading this book. It has practical suggestions about choosing, being in, and building relationships. It also connects relationships with deeper threads of life and meaning-particularly about loving- that ground relationships in our broader lives and life journeys, rather than seeing them as isolated segments of our lives. If we really get what the author is writing about, we will not only have healthy relationships, but we'll love and value ourselves and our connection with a force of love much more powerful than can come from any one person.\", 'If you are a woman who dreams of the simple innocence of by-gone times, read \"Jane Eyre\".

Any one who enjoys fun books,this is one I would personally recommend.', \"The novel is written beautifully, and it makes a bold statement about humanity... The government has developed its own language, is at constant war with the other two superstates, and watches its citizens at all times. Each superstate has an identical government, one that is at perpetual war in order to gain complete power over its citizens. The process used to gain absolute power is one used by past, present, and future dictators, such as Stalin, Mussolini and Hitler. The nation manipulates its citizens into convenient modes of thinking. However, instead of only using propaganda techniques, they also use Newspeak and telescreens. Newspeak is the official language of Oceania, and has its sole purpose in abolishing all independent thought. This is done by drastic reduction of vocabulary, by getting rid of unnecessary words and synonyms. (Example: the word bad is replaced by the word 'ungood.') The telescreens monitor each citizen at all times, watching for any action, word, or possible thought that could be unorthodox. These two Orwell inventions were foretelling, we see the equivalent of Newspeak every day in present society when we are &quot;politically correct.&quot; Telescreens are present in nearly every business, and sometimes in our own homes. Orwell was obviously warning America and all other countries about the control of totalitarian governments. The reader is introduced to the metaphysical philosophy behind 1984. A government not unlike present ones is at the head of Oceania, and that is where the reality of 1984 becomes evident. The sole manipulative technique used by Big Brother is one that is virtually unrecognizable, mental manipulation. Metaphysics, or the belief that there is existence beyond our comprehension, is represented by Big Brother when the reader learns about doublethink, the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's mind simultaneously and fully accepting both. Doublethink and metaphysics are the engines behind the three world governments, and is defined by O'Brien. &quot;Reality exists in the human mind, and nowhere else,&quot; says O'Brien. &quot; In the mind of the Party, which is collective and immortal. Whatever the Party holds to be truth is truth.&quot; The book reminds us of what has gone wrong, what can go wrong, and what will go wrong when government becomes all-powerful. It is because of this political and social insight that 1984 is one of the best books of all time.\"]\n",

It meanders and never gets to the point. Perhaps the writer meant to be impressionistic, but doesn\\'t have the skill to really pull that off. Perhaps it was too literally translated, but I don\\'t think that was the real problem. The translator seems to do well enough with the material he was presented with, even providing some explanatory footnotes for historical terms and aspects of life in the former GDR. And his translator\\'s essay at the end of the book is superior to Hensel\\'s jottings. I doubt Hensel is the right person to provide an interesting reminiscense of growing up in East Germany, or life since then.

This tells his story of how he survived and how the rest of his family did not.It starts when he was small, he was living a decent life, his father owned a shop. But when the Germans walked through the streets with guns in their hands, he didn't know what it meant, but his parents were getting worried. Later on, he knew exactly what it meant when the Germans passed by.He waited a long time until he was sent on a train with a very little food or anything for that matter. Not many people survived that ride, they were willing to commit suicide because the couldn't take it anymore. Another reason was because of starvation, or dehydration, most of the people there couldn't live under those conditions.When they arrived, they first separated the men from the women.

Nonetheless, I\\'ll make two points about \"Great Expectations\", which is the first Dickens novel I\\'ve read since my adolescence. (Kennedy was President, alas.)First, I\\'ll say that the characters in this book are affecting exaggerations and not quite real. For example, Joe Gargery, the blacksmith, is touching in his decency and saintly in his generosity. But Dickens gives him no rough emotional edges, and so he never rises beyond rustic sentimentality. Likewise, Hebert Pocket, Pip\\'s friend, is a lovely young man but exists in friendship with out making any demands. And, there is the resolute and controlling Mrs. Havisham and her pathetic martyrdom. Yes, she was hurt by a man. But, it\\'s hard to imagine a person living in the filth and disorder of her mansion, unless she is crazed, like a modern street person. To sum this up, I\\'d say that his characters are not really persuasive, even though they resonate emotionally.Second, I was surprised by the near total lack of visual effects in the writing. Early on, there\\'s a moment of visual writing when young Pip is in the cemetery. But thereafter, this element is all but lacking in the book. Even after several re-readings, for example, I could never quite see Magwitch tumble into the river.Regardless, I enjoyed the read and did not find it discursive or too long. Go for it!', \"As a fan of bestselling writers Lorenzo Carcaterra and Val McDermid I agree with their respective reviews of this book.

I\\'ve watched a movie or two based on it. It could be better.Hamlet (the character) has problems. Apparently, his step-father killed his father. This obsesses Hamlet, who,also, is depressed, manic, neurotic, and fearful. Still, count up the dead bodies that accumulate during the play!One of the problems with the play is the \"play-within-a-play\" that goes on for too long. The complete Hamlet can play for over four hours, which is not good for business. Fantastic directors usually manage to get it done in under three hours. Usually, 10% or more of the lines get chopped. The play still drags. Also, usually, someone much too old plays Hamlet. Hamlet should be played by a 16 to 18 year old. So, it is easy to go wrong with this play.Nevertheless, this play fascinates us, all. Do not be satisfied with only one version of this play.', \"How does Steinbeck gain entrance into the souls of people, to view what they are really like?

I didn't want this book to end because I had become part of the family, and you never want the family to end. It amazes me how Steinbeck can write deeply, but his writing is readable. He really just sucks you into his world, you feel as though you are there around the table, discussing the Hebrew word, looking out the house into the valley, or staring at the house where the &quot;circus&quot; is going on.

      "['\"The Black Echo\" is about L.A. detective Harry Bosch and F.B.I. agent Eleanor Wish, who, not so coincidentally, become involved in the death of a man Harry once knew in Vietnam. They set out to solve a death that appears to be a suicide overdose, but to Harry\\'s perspicacious eyes have see too many in congruencies to be content with appearances.The story is well-hewn, but not as taut, as some of the other Bosch novels. Parts VI, VII, and VIII (about 100-200 pages, depending on edition) especially could be radically reduced with a finer sheen. The story sort of drags to bring in some characters that have only incidental merit to the overall plot.As a Californian, I knew many of the acronyms and numerical titles for PCH (Pacific Coast Highway), 405 (San Diego Freeway), 10 (Santa Monica Freeway), but Connelly uses these shorthand equivalents in a way that might make the distant reader feel confused. He\\'s given to using these initials in the text (such as O.M. for Old Man), that\\'s rather offputting.Overall recommended.', \"This is the one book and especially hardback in the past years that is worth every cent and maybe more.

Well, I had never read Barrie's story, so I started this audiobook with the expectations that it would be a fun diversion but nothing really more special than the Disney adaptation. I could not have been more wrong.First, as to the story, it really is quite magical. It's a sweet and imaginative tale that will delight children and adults with excitement and fun at every turn. Peter is not nearly as one dimensional as...well, the cartoon version of himself, and I even found myself feeling rather sorry for Captain Hook and Smee.Moving on to the audio aspect of the book... I'm certain Barrie's wit and creativity would jump off the page if you were to read the written version, but I have to say that Jim Dale's rendition is brilliant. His pacing is perfect, and the voices he does are fantastic. I honestly think this is one of the best audiobooks, if not the best, I've ever experienced.\", \"The book was not bad but I think the author wrote too much about the letters which Philip had found. I am sure that the last chapter was the best part of the book. I don't like the part in the middle very much because it was lenghty and quite boring.

Macaulay is one of the supreme victorian stylist, if not unquestionably the greatest. He is also one of the forefathers of modern liberalism. The prose is brilliant, and Macaulay has bettered his master, Scott, in his renderings of a bygone era. That much being said, we deplore the need to abridge this masterpiece. Five volumes might sound daunting, but Macaulay is entertaining enough to sustain our interest throughout the length of the book. The abridgements are so extensive that the introduction is reduced to 3 pages, and the recreation of the reign of King Charles II is entirely lost. Buy this book by all means, but if you can find the full version, give that a try. A wonderful companion to this book is Hume's History of England.\", \"I was pessimistic when our Literature teacher assigned us this book.

I think that anyone, young or older child, teen, or adult would love every page of it. I felt that it went by fast most of the time, but some parts were repeatable.

THANK YOU!', 'The main contribution of the book to Pico scholarship is its detailed and precise study, never attempted previously, of the Kabbalistic translations made for Pico, their contents and sources, and all the texts and doctrines of Pico that are dependent on the Kabbala in both their content and sources. It appears that Pico, with the help of his Hebrew associates, and especially of Mithridates, was the first Christian scholar who attained an accurate and detailed understanding of the Kabbalistic writings and doctrines, and that he proved his originality not only in the choice he made among the manifold and often contradictory ideas, selecting those that suited his own beliefs, ideas, and preferences, but also in the way he restated these doctrines and combined them with either his own ideas or those derived from other sources.As a careful and critical scholar, Wirszubski leaves many points open or uncertain, but on many others he arrives at firm conclusions which show that many conventional or fashionable opinions on the subject are either too vague or are outright mistaken.Every serious historian of philosophy and of ideas should be grateful to Wirszubski for this solid and interesting contribution.', 'Many schoolboys in the developed world may know that malaria is the second largest killer of mankind in human history. (As a brief aside, the largest killer is ....... man!) I came to this book knowing very little else about the tropical disease. Yes, I knew that it was transmitted by mosquito bites, but my knowledge ended shortly after that point. Therefore I will readily admit to learning a great deal from this book ? about disease transmission and treatment in general and malaria in particular, and of the wonderful, quinine-bearing ?Peruvian bark? of the cinchona tree. The subject areas covered are enormous: combining more than 350 years of medicine, discovery, colonial conquests, papal intrigues, botany, and biological research. It whets the appetite, and shows that there is much to look into further.The huge scope is both an advantage, and a disadvantage; an advantage because it gives the reader a context, but it highlights areas worthy of greater coverage with some parts a little sparse. There is little of the effectiveness of quinine (from the ?miraculous fever tree?), when compared to modern anti-malaria drugs ? the problems of, say Larium, have been well documented elsewhere. However, the author uses her own family background to off-set the story, and the approach is particularly effective. Parts are from her own story (growing up in Africa), whilst other small portions cover that of relatives (her great grandfather worked on building of the Panama Canal, and survived the ravages of both yellow fever, and malaria).The dedication of early doctors, and plant specialists shines through, although in some sections the numerous individuals entering the story seem part of a list of people, places and dates. The telling of the mosquito life cycle, and the discovery of the effect of the insect is very good, with detail from the works of both Ronald Ross and Patrick Manson in the 1890?s. I did not realise that malaria was hitherto both so geographically extensive, and so important in war. This included both the Napoleonic wars, and the American Civil War. The life expectancy of British soldiers in West Africa in the early 19th century was less that 6 months, and was a calculated waste of life.An interesting note is the prevalence of malaria in Europe, with the fatal effects of the papal enclave of 1623; a number of the electing cardinals did not return from their Pope-choosing visit to Rome. Malaria was also very evident in the Essex marshes in the late 17th century; immune local men would go to the hills in search of another woman when a wife died in the lower (malaria infested) regions. Some men had 14 or 15 wives, but never more than one at a time. Perhaps that is where the ?Essex girl? jokes started.My overall feeling is that the book does not quite achieve its aim, chiefly because it is so hugely ambitious. It is however a very good read, and may even entice you to read further on the subject (with ample source material listed by the author). I am left at the end realising that there are still about 3,000,000 deaths each year from malaria, and most of these are preventable, whether that is using the product of the cinchona tree, or by some other means. The story may encourage people to strive for the eradication of the disease.

      "[\"This book really helped me to see how there are forces at work in our lives that we do not know about. Coelho has made me believe through this simple story that God is still present with us everyday, and active in our lives. He is not religiously pushy, however, like some writers in this genre. He leaves a lot of room for the reader to make his own interpretation of what is presented, broadening the prospective audience. This simple story of Coelho and his wife's quest renewed my faith in a lot of things. I had mixed thoughts about reading a religiously focused book when I picked up The Alchemist a few months ago, but the message therein really helped me put a lot of things into perspective, and Valkyries was no different.\", 'It\\'s difficult to describe how much this book has meant to my family.

Ultimately, each family has to do what is right for them. But facts be told, after 17 years in the field of pediatric cardiology, it is clear to me that the 3 stage procedure ending in a Fontan does NOT give a good, long-term outcome. The majority of the children with this surgery do well until their teen years (this is why the other reviewers with children in their school age year feel the surgery is such a success). What they fill eventually find out is that most patients with a Fontan go into heart failure approximately 10-15 years after the procedure is performed. Some undergo another surgery to revise their hearts once again; some undergo heart transplant, most children get progressively more incapacitated and ultimately die in their late teens or early 20's. If this is what you consider to be a great outcome, the surgical approach is certainly an option for you. But if were given the same choice as Ms. Kuebelbeck and her family during any of my pregnancies, I would have chosen the exact same path that she did, because I've seen the tragedy these families experience first-hand.I think this book should be offered to anyone who is carrying a child with HLHS; by offering them a great example of the option of comfort care, it at the very least allows them a chance to decide whether this is the best option for their family, without sugar-coating the reality of the situation.\", \"Jean Plaidy's The Lady in the Tower tells the story of the rise and fall of Henry VIII's second wife Anne Boleyn, and charts her life from her beginnings at the French court until her execution for treason.Anne, who many consider to be Henry VIII's most fascinating queen, has been the subject of countless retellings. What I like about Plaidy's novel is that it is written in first person as a kind of memoir while Anne is imprisoned in the Tower of London, and tells her story from her own point of view. This creates a sympathetic portrait and helps in humanizing a historical figure who was greatly hated and villified in her own day.A very great and interesting read. I am so happy that many of Plaidy's other novels are being re-released for a new generation of readers to enjoy.\", \"This book is great and I don't really prefer reading.

A superbly paced capture/wartime/woman-in-charge story with a little magic and a fabulous horse thrown in.', 'Asimov\\'s Golden Age classic Foundation Trilogy is one of the early milestones of the science fiction genre. This second installment is less episodic than the first volume, focusing on just two specific stories. The first volume, &quot;Foundation&quot;, sets up the whole idea of the Seldon Plan, a mathematically based view of sociopolitical forces that enables one brilliant scientist to grow a new galactic empire from a foundation of one hundred thousand scientists and their families. &quot;Empire&quot; starts off in the same vein, showing how the Foundation staves off annihilation at the hands of the currently decaying, but still dangerous Galactic Empire. Once again, the magic of this section is the subtle means by which the Foundation overcomes impossible odds, and the convincing arguments Asimov uses to make the solution seem inevitable. Part Two involves an internal struggle between the Foundation\\'s authoritarian central government and the Independent Traders who spread that government\\'s economic power. While the Foundation is threatened with civil war, the rise of a new warlord on Kalgan poses a danger to the entire human race.Because each story is substantially longer than those in Foundation, this volume focuses more on individual characters. In fact, it is not too much to say that a major theme is the historical question, \"Do individuals matter?\" As a result, the characters are developed slightly more, and there\\'s even a wistful love triangle, and considerably more action than was featured in the first volume, which tended to be distant and impersonal. If you liked Foundation, you\\'ll surely enjoy this and the climax to the series, Second Foundation.Although these books will strike many as hopelessly dated, Asimov\\'s sweeping historical vision should not be missed by any fans of speculative fiction. They have a directness and honest charm about them that is rare in contemporary science fiction. Later additions to this series, both sequels and prequels, don\\'t adhere to the tone of these original novels, and really add very little except bulk.', 'I buy many cookbooks.

This novel is just great.With each of the novels in the series, Robb delves into a different supporting character - fleshing out Mavis and Peapody in past novels, for example. Summerset gets his turn in this one.In a truly entertaining plot, Summerset is framed and Dallas is forced to take her investigation underground or risk making Roarke himself the prime suspect. The villain is targeting Roarke, and is taking out everyone who helped Roarke avenge the death of Summerset's daughter 15 years ago. And we get the added entertainment of Dallas defending Summerset - Robb adds to the previous background behind Summerset's disdain for Dallas. Unlike past novels in this series, Robb makes it very hard to figure out who the villain is and yet when we do, it's very logical.The love affair between Dallas and Roarke is finely shaped, some good sparring and making up, excellent intensity. We continue to have witty exchanges between Peabody and Dallas, and meet McNab, who will be developed in a later novel.A great read!\", 'I consider myself pretty open minded with respect to &quot;new age&quot; things, but this book was ridiculous.

The author isn\\'t vague nor does she use alternate terms for things, or attempt to \"dumb it down\" at all.

She knew many German aristocrats, including ones who suffered the extreme penalty for opposing Hitler. I found fascinating the account of how life went on in aristocratic circles in Germany while bombs dropped and Hitler ran his terroristic regime. This is another view entirely from Victor Klemperer's monumental volumes entitled I Will Bear Witness, which I read with sheerest fascination on June 11, 1999, and April 7, 2000, since Missy, the author, almost seemed to bear a charmed life. But like Klemperer's diary, time seemed to move so slow as one reads, knowing that not till May 8, 1945 would the ordeal end--and not even then because life in Germany postwar was no bed of roses for some time. If one considers the author as the young woman she was, not one in a position to answer for the rise of Hitler or to impede his ruinous course, the diary is a moving tribute to the human spirit.\", \"When I was looking for P.J.Tracy's latest bookk I got excited when I saw the new title, 'Monkeewrench'.

Golding wanted to show the readers that the only difference between human beings and beasts is that we are governed by laws and civilization, without which we do become savages. Disturbing, extremely, but that doesn't mean it isn't a good book. Someone once told me the purpose of art and literature is to make an audience think through its powerful messages, not to be comfortable to place in a &quot;hospital&quot; setting. Lord of the Flies does exactly that. Through vivid descriptions and masterful symbolism, this book conveys a powerful message regarding human nature. A previous reader claimed, due to the Columbine shootings, this book should not be read in high schools, I couldn't disagree more. It is because of such atrocious acts that the message this book contains is needed more than ever.\"]\n",

At the end, I wondered if Siddons deliberately created two unlikable people to create a sense of ambivalence in the reader about the effect of the house on their little sheltered lives.By the last page, I was simultaneously rooting for the House Next Door and for the book to end.', 'Coetzee manages to portray the current situation in South Africa very well. He gives an inside view on the dilemma that white people face nowadays.The characters presented in the novel symbolize different ways how to handle the difficult situation after apartheid.

No one knows how traditional his methods are because like all else our understanding changes over time. Anyone familiar with Patangali's Yoga Sutras will know how concentrated his teaching is, or rather will appreciate that the sanskrit he taught in was a precision instrument difficult to explain to English speakers with a vast and shifting vocabulary. Patangali was not only a great exponent of yoga but also of sanskrit, the most ancient language still known, precursor of Greek, Latin and most other languages. Patanjali considered the sanskrit word for anything was sound equivalence of the thing itself. A different world, a world of sound and silence it is difficult to comprehend, to enter.Yet Iyengar has entered and lived in that world most of his life.Moreover he has a use of English that enables him to take us along with him. This is not a book to read in a day or two, which would scarcely be possible and certianly totally indigestable. It is a book to get to know in silent study, preferably a page or two a day whilst sitting in one's favourite asana. Everything Iyengar wants to convey and through him Patangali wants to convey is already part of your makeup as a person living in the world of nature around you. The Yoga Sutras were compiled to allow you to be yourself by getting to know yourself thoroughly. Although an alarming prospect at first sight it need not be under such expert guidance.It is hardly conceivable that this book would mean anything at all to anyone who has not even begun yoga training. On the other hand anyone wishing to embark on exploration and improvement of self could read this book alongside Light on Yoga, learning simple yoga at first but gaining early insight into the subject from the Yoga Sutras.Existential Buddhists will need to be tollerant of Iyengar's Hindu worship of idols (eye catching cover illustrations only) and translation of Isvara as God, these are superficial practices he, like Ghandi, adopted as their native contemporary Indian culture, harmless enough, they do not detract from brilliant lives and expositions of perennial philosophy.Great soul, great book, used as intended it is the best purchase you are ever likely to make.\", \"Let me begin by saying that for the most part, I LOVE Dan Simmons. I was very excited when this book arrived and dug right in. That's when my disappointment hit... I couldn't wait for this book to end. Within the first 3rd of the book I caught myself skimming, throughout the rest of the book I struggled with the fact that I was not enjoying the story and had to force myself to read.This was a book that should have been about telepathy and mind reading, should have been a very exciting read, and could have been brilliant. Instead Simmons spends large parts of the book dropping the plot and spending page after page explaining the physics behind mind reading, and it doesn't make a whole lot of rational sense. Jumping back and forth between a plot that could have been entertaining, and a lecture on the physics of mind reading wore out my brain... especially since the physics part was completely unnecessary to the story. Then you throw in the completely out of nowhere idea that a mind reader would end up in all the different situations that occur in this book from serial killers to gun wielding Mafioso none of it came together. I struggled with this book, not because it was overly difficult, but because it was completely un-engaging to me.\", \"Compiled and edited by journalist, lecturer, and broadcaster Michael Ford, Eternal Seasons: A Liturgical Journey With Henri J.M.

At the end of WWI with revolution all over Central Asia (and a lot of other parts of the world), the collapse of monarchies, and civil strife in most countries, Britain was in imperial overreach turbo mode... How to deal with all of these troubles simultaneously while retaining the Empire?Bailey gives you an idea of the kind of person, military man, cool headed, well educated, politically astute, able to command men in battle, fair and just: a reflection of a mindset that battle and force are the last resorts to settle conflict. A few good men on the ground, grinding up their shoe leather, sending out reports and defining the risk, ensured that Britain got involved only when empire and country were threatened.Men on the ground made this decision and Bailey is your classical \"our man in Tashkent\" -- the hero of Buchan novels (which sadly few read anymore). His story is one daring escape after the other, double crosses within doublecrosses, and the ubiquitous agent provocateur which could be anyone.....Bailey\\'s journey through Central Asia was to assess the status of roaming Central Power troops and bloodthirsty bolsheviks -- always wearing guns to intimidate, and always failing with our hero Bailey. Bailey is at a disadvantage because he does not often have an good idea what his govt. is doing and so he engages in light banter with Bolsheviks who ask him how he gets off on coming to the heart of Bolshevist Central Asian, Turkestan when British troops are fighting against the Bolsheviks in Archangel and Baku? Since Bailey realises that the Bolsheviks are often as scarce of data as he is, he injects doubt into the conversation? How does the Commissar know that these were actually British troops? This suffices not because the Bolsheviks buy any of it, but because they are too busy planting agents speying on him to learn his \"true\" purpose and whomsoever in the counterrevolutionary movement he may be dealing with.Still this game can only be played so long and then it is time for Bailey to hide, and hide fast as the Bolsheviks want his head. In a number of disguises our hero goes through questioning while dressed as a local, passes the bolsheviks in a purloined Austrian uniform and, moving from safe-house to safe-house and knowing how to survive in the desert, he conducts espionage against the Bolsheviks and lives a life always just one half step ahead of the bolsheviks... sometimes they were literally yards away from him....This true story by an incredibly self-effacing man has something of import for the modern world. I kept thinking that the situation at the end of the World War was at least as worse (or worse) than the present time in Central Asia and the Middle East. People in 1918 were worried Bolshevism would sweep the world order away as everywhere the objective facts seemed to support the inexorable rise of the Reds. But the British (more or less) kept their heads and deployed resources rather wisely. They built up whole generations of people schooled in the culture of the Empire. Say what you want about Imperialism in general, but the particular variant of British Colonialism engendered a respect for local languages and cultures, and a notion that there were firm limits on the extent of direct control by \"boots on the ground\" -- and if boots were not necessary, or simply too expensive then people like Col. Bailey were the men to monitor and look after British interests, by subterfuge and stealth -- they never had the luxury of overwhelming force.His tale is moving, heart thumping in detail, while being understated -- this man wanted no praise.As such I could not help thinking what went wrong and why the modern imperialists like the US lack even a single person of this ilk, and why their culture did everything possible to thwart the nuturing of such spies before 2001. The US emphasis today is upon brute and overwhelming force to shape the world its image -- it is inward looking. Bailey and his contemporary British officers realised that a good man highly educated in the local languages and cultures, aware of the world so to speak, in the right place could obviate the need for an armed expedition, look after national interests... and make for a ripping read.There is much the US can learn from men such as Bailey.', 'This book is a biographical gem. It reviews the life and photography of David Seymour in an understated style of writing which was the man himself; bald, spectacled, yet powerful in his humanity and in his skill at nurturing friendships with photography as a shared interest.He lived a romantic European life of high times and tragic personal losses including his own premature death in 1956.The photographs are brilliant. Foreground and background tell a story in many of the photos. It is not a book of nudes or still-lifes. It is more intimate than that.', 'I really loved this book from the beginning to the end. I\\'m a fan of Oscar Wilde, and I could\\'ntmiss this great classical novel. The book is dominated by two amazing and strong personalities :Dorian Gray,a character full of life, and his friend and mentor Lord Henry Wotton.The story is deliciously dark and unusual, and as far as I know this is the only novel Wilde hadever written. It provides an interesting look on the society of the time through this multi-layeredstory, and Dorian Gray is a perfect representation of the human species. The novel depicts anundeniable influence of the French Decadence movement of the late 19th century, and allows thereader to understand better why it upset the British society that was emerging from the socialconstraints of Victorianism. I appreciated the beauty of his writing style, always elegant, witha flow that looks like poetry all along the book. The conversations exchanged are also witty andpoignant.Maybe some people could find the flow of the story quite slow, or with too many descriptions,which may not give enough room for imagination. Also the text was a little small, but remainedvery readable.Anyway, I highly recommend this book. It is a great way to start discovering Oscar Wilde\\'s workthrough this book full of mystery, which still asks today this valid question: \"What are peoplewilling to sell to get eternal beauty?\"', \"When he died on July 21, 1957, Kenneth Roberts was working on an historical novel of the American Revolutionary War which featured the battle of Cowpens. The description of the battle which was published as the fourth volume of the *Kenneth Roberts Reader of the American Revolution* was his last piece of historical writing. It was published in an abridged version by *Collier's*, and reprinted in 1976 as a booklet by Herbert Faulkner West. West also included a five-page extract from a piece written by Roberts in 1936 and originally published in *Modern Book Collecting for the Impecunious Amateur*, describing Roberts' method of historical research and setting forth his belief that historical novelists, by the nature of their art, are often much more careful with their historical sources than professional historians.*The Battle of Cowpens* itself, an eighty-page essay, starts by describing the general context of the battle, with Clinton first occupying Charleston then leaving Cornwallis in charge of South Carolina, and Cornwallis disobeying Clinton's orders by deciding to strike at Virginia, resulting in the defeat of Horatio Gates at Camden, South Carolina. (Those who have read *Rabble in Arms* know Roberts' opinion of Gates, which he reiterates here.) The two protagonists of the Battle of Cowpens are then presented: Daniel Morgan, the leader of the American troops, whom Roberts compares to his hero of the Northern Army, Benedict Arnold; and Banastre Tarleton, &quot;an incomparable cavalry leader&quot;, who later became a member of Parliament and died in 1833, aged seventy-eight (contrary to the fictional character of William Tavington in Gibson's *The Patriot*, who was loosely based on him.)The battle itself is described in detail, sometimes polemically or in a dramatized way, with extracts from Nathanael Greene's orders to Morgan, and from Morgan's and Tarleton's own accounts of Cowpens (the latter wrote a *History of the Campaigns of 1780 and 1781 in the Southern Provinces of North America*, which Roberts used as a source.) Strategic and tactical maps are included at the end, together with a profile of the Cowpens, as relief played an important part in Morgan's battle plans.The booklet is just as gripping as an episode from the British TV series *In the Line of Fire*, with Roberts' evocative style doing the work of the computer graphics. It is definitely a good place to start for those who have seen Mel Gibson's *The Patriot* and wish to know what really happened at the battle that inspired its climactic action sequence.\", \"I'm soooooooooo happy I got this book! Not knowing anything about Ms.Cole I went purely off the short amazon synopsis for the pre-sale of the book & thought it sounded mildly entertaining.It ended up being one of the 2 best books I've read this year.

But when he finds Emmaline he's shocked to find that she is a vampire, the very species which has imprisoned him.Emmaline is just a co-ed from Tulane touring around Paris trying to find out who her mom & dad were. Yes, she is a vampire- or atleast partly one. She's also a Valkyrie and was raised by her warrior aunts. When the growling crazy guy tackles her on the streets of Paris she freaks! Who wouldn't? But he quickly forces her to experience steamy hot new adventures. Does she have Stolkholm Syndrome to be bonding with this shocking weirdo? Or are they destined to be together? More importantly...what will her vampire dad think of him? What will his werewolf subjects think of her.\", \"My 1 year old daughter LOVES this book. She carries it everywhere and tries to take it to bed with her. She is just getting the hang of moving each of the pages, but it keeps her interest for quite awhile. I'd give it more than 5 stars if I could!!!\", '1984 is extremely influential on the way we as a society label each other and our government with names such as \"Big Brother\" Orwellian and such. These names like calling someone a Nazi allow us to appear to argue but actually allow us to dodge the real issues. This is fairly ironic considering the origin of such terms. Basically 1984 is set in London in the distopian future. Orwell wrote it in response to Stalin\\'s corrupting the ideals of Socialism. He was a socialist and so was really bothered by that failure.The plot to 1984 isn\\'t so important as the setting. Basically the story follows Winston Smith. Smith harbors less than perfect views of his environment, for which he will one day be arrested regardless of his actions. Not loving the government (thought crime) is the only crime that is recognized. Hidden cameras and microphones are omnipresent in the city, included mandatory TVs which can\\'t be turned off, only show a single government station and contain hidden cameras through which \"thought police\" may monitor what is in front of the TV at any time. Social interaction doesn\\'t exist, since that would be considered weird and therefore criminal.There are three classes of people in London: Inner Party members, Party members like Winston and the proletariate, who aren\\'t watched so closely because they aren\\'t considered human. In this world Winston goes from merely not liking the government to engaging in unusual behavior. He starts by buying decorative antiques at a proletariate shop and progresses to having a girl friend, who he can only meet with in remote country side settings on account of social interaction is not allowed by the government. It is obvious to him that he will one day be taken to the Ministry of Love, a windowless building which handles law enforcement, and never fails at getting thought criminals to love the government.The novel is always dark. No happy beginning, no happy middle and no happy ending. Still it is important to read it before throwing around terms like \"Orwellian\" It has been so influential on society that it is required reading - if you want to pass your tenth grade English. Failing to read is a sign of insurgence against the government.', 'This was a very entertaining and interesting book. I thought Twain did a great job incorporating the newer (of his time) technologies into the old mid evil times. Not only did I think he did this very well; he had a very interesting take at explaining the great achievements of knights that do not seem to be what we would consider real. Like when knights fought giants and things of that nature, and how magic was explained. I thought it was interesting how he explained that a lot of the knights did not really do a lot of the things that they said, like kill ogres and giants, they only said they did because no one was around, and no one ever questioned the adventures that the knights told of. Another cool thing was how he incorporated newer technologies, like gunpowder, into how he did his \"magic\" and made people believe that he was a great sorcerer. This was a very good and interesting book, and I would recommend it to anyone.']\n",

      "['Notice: \"To Thieves, Murderers, and Short-Card Artists;You are no longer welcome in Confusion.Those listed below can get out or shoot it out,and start any time they are ready.\"In western Utah lies the raucous boom town of Confusion, a place where lawlessness has had its way and the good people can only look on in horror. Confusion, site of the latest gold rush, is days old only and composed of tents and quickly nailed-up frame buildings. The prospect of gold will draw in the honest, hard-working sorts, but also them wild elements. Restless drifter and notorious gunfighter Matt Coburn was only passing thru and didn\\'t want no part of Confusion. But he\\'s got a reputation for cleaning up ornery towns, and when push came to shove, he didn\\'t have it in him to turn his back on something that desperately needed doin\\'. Now Matt Coburn, reluctant town tamer, wears a badge in Confusion and staring down all sorts of mean pistoleros, knife artists, cardsharps, claim jumpers, and drygulchers. Matt Coburn is calling himself all kinds of fool.The blurb on the back of my battered paperback touts it as a \"hairtrigger action western,\" and that\\'s no fib. THE EMPTY LAND is one of Louis L\\'Amour\\'s most exciting novels. That\\'s saying something because this author\\'s stories are never ever these sluggish melodramas. No, his yarns are lean and action-packed. They are hellaciously good reads. This time out, L\\'Amour seems to write with even greater urgency. He provides fascinating insight into how a boom town is established. He delves into the steps required to transform a reckless boom town into a decent and thriving community.Running parallel to the narrative\\'s breakneck suspense is a thoughtful examination of the ethics of killing. From jump, several of the citizens are averse to fighting violence in kind, instead advocating a more peaceful resolution. And it\\'s not as if Matt Coburn himself hadn\\'t pondered this very same thing. He\\'s aware that he\\'s in danger of transitioning from a good man with a gun to a ruthless gunman who sees killing as the first option instead of last. Louis L\\'Amour will habitually sneak in a morality play. This enriches the story, as do L\\'Amour\\'s frequent forays into imparting history lessons on the reader. But this is done so disarmingly and these nuggets of trivia mesh so well with the narrative that it doesn\\'t at all feel intrusive or jarring. L\\'Amour\\'s love of the American Old West is infectious. He uses spare prose but he writes so vividly and with such a sense of immediacy that you feel like you\\'re there in his story, transported onscene, ducking bullets and your bum chafed mightily from your time in the saddle. And even if you dismiss the morality plays and the history lessons, THE EMPTY LAND has still got something for you, in the way of relentless, pulse-pounding action as only a true master of the American Western can deliver.', 'Many readers focus on the Theogony, which is the ancient Greeks Creation Story, and which Hesiod articulated masterfully. The descriptions of the battles between Zeus and the Titans made for vivid and stirring oration in the hands of a great speaker, as he boasts that he was by citing his awards. However, I was more intrigued by Works and Days. The advice of Hesiod was, indeed, sagacious: \"It is good to take from what is available, but sorrow to the heart to be wanting what is not.\" And I liked this one: \"Right gets the upper hand over violence in the end.\" At times he seemed like Thoreau incarnate preaching industry and self-reliance from his little cabin on Walden Pond: \"Avoid shady seats and sleeping til sunrise at harvest time, when the sun parches the skin. At that time get on with it and gather home the harvest, rising before dawn so that your livelihood may be assured. For the morning accounts for a third of the work.\" Or this one: \"For property is as life to wretched mortals.\" Some of his advice is quaint, as when a man should take a wife. The thing of it is that so much of what passed for wisdom in ancient days would still pass for it today.', \"The first time I read this book was when I was nine years old. I hated it.The second time was last week, at the age of nineteen. The first thing I noticed about &quot;The Hobbit&quot; was that, to start with, it was surprisingly childish. Not surprising, as it is a childrens' story. However, athough I have never read Lord of theRings, I could sense something bigger behind the story. It was inexorable. Towards the end of the story, the tone changes dramaically (around Chapter 14). Quickly, the language becomes almost biblical in style, eg: &quot;Thorin bent his horn bow and fired an arrow at Dale; it smote in his shield and stuck there quivering&quot;. The juvenile language all but vanishes, and a grand epic feel is created. The character of Thorin is most memorable. This is a masterpiece.\", \"Sometimes there are different degrees of good. For Servants of the Map, five stars doesn't seem to do it justice. In fact, using any sort of rating system doesn't feel right. This collection of stories is as fresh and clean as the outdoor worlds it so amazingly describes. Often, I found my mind wandering off the page, and rather than stop myself and turn back to the book, I let my thoughts linger on. The book is nostalgic in this way. It reads quietly and naturally. I felt myself living in Andrea Barrett's vivid landscapes, and communicating with her eccentrically human characters. How rarley in a book do you find two characters, both very likeable, dislike each other? Yet, how often do we find this in real life?In the second story, The Forest, as well as its companion, The Mysteries of Ubiquitin, opposing characters are quietly clashing almost all the time. Imagine two people, polar opposites, totally disgrunteled with each other, sitting comfortably on a patio near a swimming pool.I can not recommend this book more emphatically. For those of you who are scared of short stories... stop, and read this book. In those blank spaces between the stories, a larger more wonderous world is created than in most novels I've recently read, including those busting over the 1000 page barrier. This one, you'll want to reread simply to give your imagination another Andrea Barret boost!\", \"I have always been one of the few who do not think this is Agatha Christie's best book, ro even among them.

So so so good. But then, no book deserves five starts for a simple twist.

Both are presumed dead, but Tanya had really managed to survive and begin a new life in the States. Now, eight years later, she is finding herself called back to the Venezuelan jungles to find out what really happened to her family and her darling Shannon.Meanwhile, the full plot of the drug plots takeover is revealed. More than just drugs, Tanya's family's plantation is now going to be the home of a terrorist cell intent on attacking America. To stop the terrorists and unravel the mystery of her past, she'll have to work with a rogue CIA agent called Casius who has more than one secret he's not telling. It all hurtles forward to a stunning conclusion that speaks volumes on the themes of love, loss, and the power of prayer.Quite honestly, this novel is probably the weakest of the three. While it's certainly well-done, its tone and focus are slightly different than its two predecessors. This is most likely attributed to the fact that was adapted from Dekker's first (and unpublished) novel To Kill With Reason. It lacks a certain gravitas the other books carried and seems a bit disconnected from the scope of the rest of the trilogy. It doesn't fit seamlessly, but Dekker makes it work well. It's a solid book as a standalone, but comes off a bit lackluster compared to the brilliance of the first two novels. Dekker would later polish up some aspects of this story and later use the core fundamentals in novels such as Thr3e and Burn. All in all, it's another solid offering for Dekker, and served to springboard him into the success he found beginning with 2004's Circle Trilogy.\", \"First of all this is a review of the special leather-bound edition of Harry Potter and the sorcerer's stone.

This review deals not with the merits of the work, but with the merits of the publication policy that forces teachers of this classic to adopt a new translation of stop teaching the classic.One can also not deny that the Ward translation offered to us by Vintage as the only available translation of the classic is competent. This review is also not meant to be an attack on Ward\\'s translation. It is, however, in my view, markedly inferior to the previous Gilbert translation as a work of art and in conveying Camus\\'s spirit and intentions to modern readers. I recognize that this evaluation is open to debate among intelligent readers. The point of this review is that scholars and teachers of the book should be able to make the decision as to the relative merits of the translations by themselves, for reasons germane to the artwork, not publishers for reasons that have more to do with money.When a publisher comes out with a new translation of a classic, they have an obligation to leave the old translation in print, or allow it to be published elsewhere, to allow readers to choose for themselves.It is a travesty that a generation of readers instead of feeling the power and strangeness of the opening lines of the novel, \"Mother died today, or maybe yesterday ...,\" will instead wonder what Maman is and what a strange word it is to American ears.It is an even greater travesty that the publication of classics in translation has become like the publication of other textbooks, with a new edition forced upon us every few years for monetary reasons. The fans of Ward\\'s translation should not be happy about this trend either. When the expiration its copyright appears on the horizon, or when too many used copies of it accumulate in college bookstores, we can expect it to share the same fate as Gilbert\\'s.Faculty teaching this classic, no matter what their choice of translation, should not stand by and allow their choice of texts to be taken out of their hands.', 'A classic!

The first time was as a youth a very long time ago and it had a positive impact on me. I decided to reread it and see what additional insights it would bring into my life. It was clearly worth the few hours of my time it took to read this book. The device Lewis uses is very clever and forces one to look at sin, pride, and mediocrity from a totally different viewpoint. It becomes clear that it\\'s not the big mistakes we make in life that really hurts us; sometimes those are the things that cause us to reevaluate our lives and repent. The things that really hurt us are the pride and the accumulation of little sins. Lewis seem to really be pushing for greatness of soul. Bottom line is this little book made me think about my life. That is what a good book should do.The book also includes the essay, \"Screwtape Proposes a Toast\". This was written much later and instead of Screwtape writing letters advising Wormwood, he is at an awards ceremony at the school for tempters proposing a toast to future and past successes. It is basically a vehicle to complain about how the modern education system focuses on mediocrity. It also brings out some very good points to ponder.I highly recommend this book to everyone.

It is funny weird and enjoyable.', 'Walt Disney is unarguably the single most important cultural figure of the 20th century, even today still known as \"Uncle Walt.\" Such a figure is important to know, and as Gabler points out Walt Disney is a hard person to get to know. He kept few close friends throughout his life and at the Disney company he increasingly seculded himself as the company grew. This is the first biography the I\\'ve read on Walt Disney\\'s life, and I really enjoyed it. There is a lot of detail in there and it reminded me of the Theodore Roosevelt books written by Edmund Morris. Of course the Morris books are more detailed. Roosevelt lived five fewer years than Disney but got two extra books.It\\'s hard today to view Walt Disney as a person. If you visit a Disney theme park or really have any view of the man today he is held up almost as a demi-god. His likeness is in statues around the world and seeing his image or even hearing his voice can get Disney fans into a religious-type fervor. The book was well balanced, showing the struggles and vices that Walt Disney the person had along with his amazing accomplishments. For everything that Walt Disney did, he was still just another person (albeit a particularly driven one). I would suggest this book to anyone interested in learning about Walt Disney\\'s life. The only thing that I felt I didn\\'t like about the book had nothing to do with the author. Walt Disney passed away from lung cancer right at the moment when he was on the verge of the greatest project in his life- Disney World and particularly EPCOT (the one that wasn\\'t built). The book builds up everything that Walt Disney was doing for years in order to prepare for the construction of EPCOT and Disney World, but unfortunately Walt passed away before this final dream was realized. For me at least it gives the book an unfinshed quality- as if there is a chapter or two missing at the end (which of course there are).', 'To anyone with a sweet-tooth for satire of the highest sort:Stop reading reviews and get your hands on a copy. It might very well change your outlook on war, and life, forever.', \"All of Diana Gabaldon's books are true works of art. Of the thousands of books I've read her storytelling distinguishes her as an artistic craftsman capable of bringing to life complex and compelling stories that blur the mind's ability to reconcile that the story is fiction and not a personal account. Read them all, read the companion and then read them all again. Every word is worth it!\", 'It\\'s hard to describe Charles Frazier\\'s debut novel, as it\\'s like nothing else I\\'ve ever read. The only other book that I\\'ve ever had trouble reviewing has been theThe Complete Conversations with God (Boxed Set), a series that makes for a rather awkward comparison considering it belongs in another genre altogether. The similarities between the two lie in the uniqueness of how the tales are told.I\\'ll start by saying that I watched the movieCold Mountain (Two-Disc Collector\\'s Edition)starring Nicole Kidman and Jude Law before reading the novel, which in hindsight, actually turned out in my favour. On reading the book I found myself captivated by the beautiful language and mellow pace of the story, something that was obviously lost in the film adaptation. Despite the film giving away the most important details of the plot, the change in the method of which the story was told meant that there were still several pleasant surprises to experience on the way. In particular, the romance between Inman and Ada is much more poignant and has a lot more weight when compared to the (rather flimsy) treatment of their love story in the film.Inman is a soldier who should be dead from his neck-wound, but who survives and decides to desert in order to return to his beloved home on Cold Mountain, North Carolina, where his love Ada is waiting for him. On the journey home, Inman struggles against the dangers of a war zone and the weakness of his own healing body, meeting several intriguing characters along the way who either help or hinder him. Meanwhile, Ada (a socialite who finds herself stranded in the middle of nowhere after her father\\'s death) struggles to maintain the derelict farmhouse she inherits. Thankfully, the help of a drifter named Ruby means that Ada gradually sheds her upper-class ways and learns how to live on the natural rhythms of the land (though she does manage to introduce Ruby to some English literature in return!)With two such different stories, it\\'s inevitable that some will enjoy one character\\'s progress over the other. Much has already been said on Inman\\'s Odyssey-like journey from the war to his home, but I found myself intrigued by the precarious situation that Ada finds herself in. Coming from such a wealthy and stable background, Ada has too much pride to return to her relations, and instead finds herself forced to become a laborer on her own land. Finding that her education, culture and social etiquette is completely useless in her new surroundings, Ada learns to live off the land - and Ruby considers it an achievement when Ada stops taking a book out into the fields with her (although Ada does manage to introduce Ruby to literature in the evening, including - you guessed it -The Odyssey (Penguin Classics)).It is tempting to describe the book as a \"Civil War book\", given the historical background of the story itself, or as a \"love story\" considering the relationship between the two protagonists. Yet the novel is neither of these things, despite the fact that \"Cold Mountain\" centers around the themes of both love and war. As others have already mentioned, reading this book with the expectation of aGone with the Windtype-story will lead to disappointment. Furthermore, the fact that the Inman and Ada spend most of the novel apart means that their initial courtship is told in mainly in the reveries of the two characters.The Civil War is just the necessary catalyst to put our protagonists on their paths toward personal growth, understanding of their place in the world and a sense of peace. Technically, the Civil War could be any war. (Well not really, considering the care and detail that Frazier puts into describing the geographical beauty and culture of America\\'s south, but that\\'s beside the point). Likewise, the love between Inman and Ada is the goal that each are moving toward, but it is the symbol of home and stability that each personify to the other rather than a sense of \"epic love\" that make up the real basis of their relationship.My point is, that this isn\\'t a book about the historical impact of the Civil War or even a star-crossed lovers\\' tale. It\\'s about the impact a war has on a select number of human beings, and how they deal with all the terrible consequences it has on the daily routines of life. Set against the chaos and destruction of war is the steady rhythm of nature and the turn of the seasons: inexorable and unchanging. And yet, that is simply *my* reading of the text - in a novel this rich and dense, there are endless possibilities for interpretation and understanding.The language is what really draws you into the novel; it is poetic and dreamy without becoming pretentious or getting in the way of the plot itself. Even when Frazier draws out the story out into flashbacks or characters\\' reveries, there\\'s always something interesting to be learnt. There are a few odd stylistic choices, the most obvious being that there are no speech marks. Instead, dialogue throughout the text is punctuated by a dash. However, since this technique is neither necessary nor distracting, there is little need to dwell on it save to point out that it\\'s there!One thing I will say though, in the inevitable comparison withGone with the Wind. When reading Margaret Mitchell\\'s novel, I felt that I was reading a part of history, something that happened a long time ago in a world that had long since disappeared. Frazier\\'s novel however - whether by intent or accident - makes the Civil War feel like something that happened in my own lifetime. The characters and their lives are so immediate that I had to keep reminding myself that had Ada, Ruby and Inman been real people, they would have died hundreds of years ago. That thought surprised me.']\n",

      "[\"While some have written that this book has not presented any new concepts, I believe what makes this book interesting is not its new concepts in marketing, but rather its 'approach' to existing concepts.What the author advocates is not only an intregrated approach to marketing, but also one that has measurable financial responsibility. The lessons may be simple, but unfortunately they also can be all too easy to lose sight of in day-to-day practice. I believe this is a good book for decision makers as an impetus to help re-center any company's approach to marketing.Additionally, I believe this book is just as good, if not better for young marketing people out there. At the end of the day, if a business does not make profits, obviously it's out of business. Marketing people that have profitable sales rather than sales alone at the forefront of their day-to-day focus are going to be that much more at an advantage to not only bring success to a company, but also to further their own careers.For the price charged, this book is a great investment provided the approach is carried through in actual practice throughout a business.\", 'No growing pains have ever been more hilarious than those of the Gilbreth clan.

According to Levine, the path to mature happiness developed in the ancient philosophies of B&Y; requires calming one\\'s conditioned beliefs and \"passions\" to allow greater control by the \"anterior mind\" (the \"mind\\'s eye\" capable of observing, contemplating, and directing the mind). At the extreme, an \"immature\" individual is entirely conditioned by his or her culture, language, and biology--yielding the positive functions of anterior mind nonfunctional. Much like a little child, such a person\\'s mental state is completely at the mercy of the external environment. He/she feels alright when a craving or ego desire is fed--but falls into tantrums and anguish whenever a craving or desire cannot be satisfied. Moreover, perception and interpretation of external events are distorted by the conditioned mind and its many unchecked passions (ego needs, cravings and attachments, fears and aversions, antipathies and resentments). The result is a life filled with suffering and illusion.Fortunately, children typically do learn to moderate their most selfish behaviors as they grow to adulthood: \"[P]art of growing up entails learning some self-transformation\" (p. 54). Nevertheless, Levine points out that our American vision of \"normal\" allows for a mix of mature and immature behavior. \"Normal\" adults experience disquieting feelings (anger, pettiness, impatience, envy) quite regularly: e.g., when \"stuck\" in a traffic jam or when passed over for promotion at work. Because such unhappy events are common, many of us spend a great deal of time and energy feeling upset about one thing or another.Levine points out that we don\\'t have to live that way. Through the cultivation of positive attitudes (harmlessness, truthfulness, trustworthiness, sexual restraint, nonmaterialism) and practices (mindfulness, yoga poses, meditation), the anterior mind is freed more and more to reflect upon one\\'s own mental processes and even transform them for the better. Thus the daily agitations diminish and we feel a greater sense of equanimity and happiness.Viewing these ancient philosophies through the lens of American \"positive psychology,\" Levine succeeds in developing a powerful \"Yogic\" model of cognitive processing that shares much with Albert Ellis (e.g., A Guide to Rational Living), Aaron Beck (Cognitive Therapy and the Emotional Disorders), David Burns (e.g., Feeling Good), and Martin Seligman (e.g., Authentic Happiness). As such, this highly readable book makes a major contribution to American \"Cognitive Therapy.\" But while mainstream cognitive approaches are limited to diverse techniques for coping with irrational thoughts or troubling events, the Yogic approach described by Levine is comprehensive and holistic. I have began working with these ancient ideas and practices -- my early results suggest a potential to transform every aspect of one\\'s life (mental, emotional, spiritual)!', \"This Medicis Prize('89) winning book is an exploration of the frontiers of identity within very ancient India. It may all be a dream as the &quot;Author's Note&quot; which precedes this 100 page text describes the narrative as an &quot;insomnia&quot; and a &quot;search for a shadow&quot;. You can make of that what you like but those evocative sentences only partially set the tone for Tabucchi's book is a playful series of encounters that his unnamed narrator-protaganist has with fellow travelers and interesting Indian characters along the way to finding a missing friend. The several encounters read like enquiries, but pleasant ones, and ones with philosophical as well as humorous overtones(in one encounter identity is compared to a suitcase). Some of the sequences are so strange you think it all must be a dream as when a female thief breaks into the narrators hotel room only to be invited to stay the night. Other meetings are full of a very engaging and speculation rich kind of conversation as in the meeting with the Hugo and Pessoa quoting eastern intellectual. If it is all a dream it is a very literate one. The last meeting takes place in the old Portugese port of Goa and there the narrator meets a lovely charming stranger to share a dinner with as he waits for a chance to spy a glimpse of his old searched for friend. But as they eat the narrator relates his &quot;story' in a way that makes one suspect there was no one and nothing to search for after all(modern fiction indeed it is). But you are left after putting this book down with a feeling of having had several intriguing conversations and having met a lovely woman. Not at all a bad feeling.

Though some of them were pretty interesting (Deer Hunter, Comfort of Strangers), I found myself wondering if Hunter actually watched all of the actor's major films. How could he include The Addiction and Suicide Kings in the Walken Top 10 but leave out the awesome performances in At Close Range and Biloxi Blues - both with gripping climax scenes that deserve essays of their own. A comparison of Walken in his stand-off with Sean Penn to Walken's flip-flop stand-off with Mathew Broderick (Walken is held at gunpoint by Penn/ Broderick held at gunpoint by Walken) sorely needed to be added to this collection.

Brin defends the latter option with great conviction, but he's no congratulatory futurist. He concedes that we may be forced to reconceptualize how we think about privacy, but at the same time he offers compelling reasons to believe that technology may open an emancipatory door to more genuine freedom. Beware the cameras, for they are coming, is Brin's mantra.

This is a book whose initial publication harks from the mid seventies, so one may assume that much of the information provided, such as the prevalence of side shows and the handling of \"freaks,\" is outdated twenty-seven years in the future. What is both relevant and helpful within the bounds of this text is the historicity of the given events and personas portrayed. There is some question as to the veracity of the statements made in that some of what Mannix writes in context does not seem to be very formal or serious. We may desire to look over this fact in that much of what Mannix writes in Freaks seems to be of great personal value and experience though it may not alleviate the strain. Daniel Mannix handles his subject matter comfortably. The pictures are often helpful, though sometimes graphic. The greatest complaint that I hold in regard to the pictures is that they seem to be somewhat disorganized in relation to the text; it is often helpful to place photographs of your subject matter with the text of your subject matter as opposed to the apparent alternative. Another point to make in the overall organization of the book is that it is sometimes redundant as Mannix tends to repeat information in latter chapters that he had already provided in former ones.Freaks grants us a view of freakdom from the end those who are labeled as freaks due (generally) to a condition retained from a birth and existence that does not conform to the norms of our idea of normal. Some of those highlighted within the text are monstrously obese, others have three legs, a few even have two heads (or faces, such as Edward Mordake ), and still, Mannix tries to reveal these to live in some sort of paradox wherein they are the same while remaining unequivocally different than all of the world. One of the biggest points that Mannix tries to get across is that this difference has been, for centuries past, the livelihood for many of these freaks. From the times wherein they were found to be bound to kings and courts to the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries as depicted in circus sideshows and carnivals, \"freaks\" have made fortunes by taking advantage of their mutated traits. The delineation may have been unknown, and yet their popularity as well unmatched by what other forms of \"entertainment\" existed during their time. The information provided, though seemingly first hand or closely networked, does not seem to be well researched or annotated. On the basis of this, we may not necessarily retain that Mannix\\'s text is necessarily reliable nor may we ascertain that many of his stories of freaks past are essentially true (he even said that some of the stories were questionable). As a very general and entertaining work, this book may suffice. As an informative source, it does provide more information on freaks than I have personally read anywhere else (though I have never read any other works on freaks). This book has worked well to help whet my mind in the area of freaks, though I still think it a bit sketchy in the area of reliability.', 'My sister and her husband have a copy of A. R.

In describing how Momsen performs the first deep sea rescue of a marooned submarine crew, Maas tells a first-class tale. He describes how Momsen became one of the Navy's best officers, often not by blindly saying &quot;yes,&quot; but more often by challenging conventional wisdom and practicing relentless innovation -- even when it was not welcome or understood. He risked his life many times. The rescue of the crew of Squalus off the Isles of Shoals, New Hampshire, is enough of a story to merit a place for Momsen. But Maas proceeds to describe Momsen's entire naval career, which includes a hand in bringing about nuclear submarines and even a stint at solving the worst problem in the entire fleet -- namely, bringing order to the Navy's worldwide mail. Momsen has been dead for more than 30 years, but his life and work are a story about leadership, innovation, practical organization politics, and being personally effective.

So, I wasn't expecting much. Having said that it was pretty good. But a lot of it just seemed far too unrealistic.First, the characters were completely unbelievable. Not that they were poorly developed, or anything like that, they were just too perfect. The two main characters, especially. They simply never made any mistakes. They were very likeable and well written, just not at all plausible in their perfection. By the time I was halfway through the book, I fully expected them to run against each other for President, only to find that they had tied, and deciding that they would govern jointly. Well, that didn't happen, but I wasn't far off.Also, I thought the way the perfect characters reacted to two particularly important events in the story just didn't feel realistic at all. I would say more, but can't really without giving anything away.Having expressed those pretty significant reservations with the plausibility of the book, it was pretty good otherwise. The characters despite their apparent perfection were well developed and interesting, and the plot was pretty compelling.I'm not really sure if I'd recommend this to someone with somany other great books out there, but if you like Jeffery Archer already, or you don't mind the unrealistic characters, then you might just like it.\"]\n",

      "['Over the past few months I have been reading, or re-reading, all of Anya Seton\\'s works, and I just finished re-reading My Theodosia, which I first read several years ago. One of the things I like about Anya Seton\\'s historical \"biographies\" is that, rather than write about the popular figures who are already the subject of countless biographies, and whose stories we already know, she instead focuses on the lesser-known minor players of history. My Theodosia, Devil Water and The Winthrop Woman all tell the stories of people that history has largely forgotten. It is probably even likely that Katherine Swynford wasn\\'t so well-known to the general public until Anya Seton wrote a book about her.In My Theodosia, Seton\\'s first book, she points her pen at Theodosia Burr Alston. Although the book is about Theodosia, the real \"main character\" of this story is actually Theodosia\\'s relationship with her father, the scheming, self-serving, but fascinating scoundrel Aaron Burr. Their father/daughter relationship was truly remarkable; while Burr was in many ways ahead of his time in his views of women, and in the way he raised and trained his daughter, at the same time he maintained a Svengali-like hold over her throughout all of her short life. She ultimately sacrificed everything -- even her chance at true love -- on the altar of devotion to her father.I think what will be most troublesome about this book to modern readers is the way Seton depicts slaves in the South (\"protruding lips around enormous white teeth, slate-back skin, and rolling eyes\") and her frequent use of the \"n\" word. I had to remind myself that she was 1) presenting blacks as they probably would have seemed to an upper-class young girl from the North in the days when slavery was still an ingrained institution in both North and South and blacks were widely considered less than human, and 2) this book was written in the 1940s, long before the days of civil rights or sensitivity to such issues.My Theodosia is a charming peek into upper-class American life in the very early 1800\\'s, and the author weaves in vignettes of some of the early American greats (James and Dolly Madison, Thomas Jefferson, Washington Irving). Seton managed to paint a vivid picture of the time and place without fulsome or verbose descriptions, a style she maintained throughout all her books. Aaron Burr\\'s escapades fill the book as they filled his daughter\\'s life, and woven throughout is a bittersweet love story of Theodosia and the true love of her life. Although this is not Anya Seton\\'s strongest work, it is highly enjoyable.', \"_Priveleged Son_ manages to hit that sweet spot that so many biographies of business figures fail to capture-- it manages to be a very good look at a business and industry and at the same time be readable and enjoyable on the level of a novel.While ostensibly a biography of Otis Chandler, it gives a fascinating look at the rise of a newspaper as local empire and the same newspaper's (largely unsuccessful) efforts to translate that into a truly national business.Without any industry focus, the story of the Chandlers and their relationship to LA is the stuff of novels (pulp fiction and true romance)-- LA grows up with its paper in this book.I was particularly fascinated to read what happened at the paper under the direction of Mark &quot;Cereal Killer&quot; Willes.

McCourt narrates his poverty filled childhood in Ireland. Angela's Ashes became popular because of the way McCourt told his story. The book is full of humor accompanied by the horror, and is told in an emotional, vivid manner. McCourt's life begins in Brooklyn. His family is penniless, and moves back to Ireland, where he spends the rest of his childhood with his mother's family. Angela, the mother, is the backbone of the family. But even at home, Angela's family rejects her because of her marriage to Malachy. Malachy is from the Protestant North, while Angela's family is from the South. Also, Malachy is not able to hold a job, and frequently spends any money he earns on alcohol.Young Frank can do little but sit back and watch as his family moves around and siblings die. As he ages, he begins to realize the situation he is in. The overall mood is distinguished by the dark settings. Every house the McCourts live in is in shambles. It is constantly raining. They were forced to beg for food and other necessities because they were unable to financially provide for their family. Frank endured poverty and starvation with only strength and his optimism on life. His schoolmates teased him about his ragged clothes. Through all the loneliness, McCourt manages to instill a ray of hope.Frank and his brothers and friends manage to find humor and hope despite of all their troubles. For instance, when the boys were playing outside, McCourt stated that the women stand because, all they do is take care of the children, clean the house, and cook. But, the men sit because they spend their time discussing the problems of the world and wondering what to do with the rest of the day (107).This is a humorous, almost satirical look at the traditional male-female roles in a family. His unconditional love for his father starts to be uncertain. Here, Frank decides that he will do what he can to escape this poverty and leave for America when he is able to do so. By the time Frank reaches his teenage years, he is the man of the house, and his dreams of going to America are closer than ever.Through perseverance and determination he eventually raises enough money to travel to America and break free from his depressing childhood. Frank learned to depend upon no one but himself, and with willpower he was able to achieve what he had dreamed of for so long. Frank is a bright student, and realizes that he can rise above the poverty and better himself somehow. Angela's Ashes is an inspiring novel with descriptive images that help to shape his fascinating tale from hardship to victory.\", 'Lots of mystery and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of the unknown it provided.

I brought away a copy from Salt Lake. The book is a curiosity to me, it is such a pretentious affair, and yet so \"slow,\" so sleepy; such an insipid mess of inspiration. It is chloroform in print. If Joseph Smith composed this book, the act was a miracle -- keeping awake while he did it was, at any rate. If he, according to tradition, merely translated it from certain ancient and mysteriously-engraved plates of copper, which he declares he found under a stone, in an out-of-the-way locality, the work of translating was equally a miracle, for the same reason.The book seems to be merely a prosy detail of imaginary history, with the Old Testament for a model; followed by a tedious plagiarism of the New Testament. The author labored to give his words and phrases the quaint, old-fashioned sound and structure of our King James\\'s translation of the Scriptures; and the result is a mongrel -- half modern glibness, and half ancient simplicity and gravity. The latter is awkward and constrained; the former natural, but grotesque by the contrast. Whenever he found his speech growing too modern -- which was about every sentence or two -- he ladled in a few such Scriptural phrases as \"exceeding sore,\" \"and it came to pass,\" etc., and made things satisfactory again. \"And it came to pass\" was his pet.

While it retains more than a little touch of fantasy, it is set in a mostly modern setting. I enjoyed his portrayal of cross-cultural communication mishaps, as well as the humor with which he presented Baba Yaga.Card also manages the multiple story-lines and viewpoints quite well, giving us a fresh perspective on almost every scene in the novel. This deft handling of characters and stories provides a fast-pace feel even in places where the story is slower.Overall, the story flows rather quickly, although some scenes seem to drag a bit. The characters are sometimes a bit unbelievable, although the more unrealistic characteristics are explained away with ease, if you're willing to accept the explanation. Card enjoys theorizing about the linear relational affects of time travel, with characters musing about how their past and present lives will intersect given certain actions.Ivan and Katerina's relationship develops slowly, but begins taking off with the crossing of worlds.

However, Henry James makes the fatal mistake of writing about things which he does not know. Right at the beginning of the story an English lord is introduced, handsome, athletic, cultivated and very rich, the arch type of ideal Victorian masculinity, the type every woman has a vague picture of in her fantasies, but unable to paint in full. He falls in love with the penniless Miss Archer and proposes to her. He is rejected. Our heroine cannot find any faults, but cannot imagine him as her husband. This is not unusual; women have their own minds, tastes and idiosyncrasies. Men have no logical explanation for the feminine taste. The English lord disappears, only to return later in the novel: this time ready to propose to another poor American girl, Miss Osmond, who, like our heroine, cannot picture herself married to this Victorian ideal. Then there is countess Gimini, Mr. Osmond\\'s sister, another penniless American woman married to an Italian count. And last, but not least, one has to mention Mr. Osmond, who wins the heart of our heroine, but ends up disappointing her. There are several other characters, but three are worth mentionening: Miss Stackpole (here James is in his own element, depicting an independent, yet traditionally sentimental American woman), Mr. Goodwood, the ardent lover of Elizabeth Archer, who seems to have no other purpose in life than run after a woman who has decidedly rejected him and beg for her hand. Mr. Goodwood is portrayed as the athletic type with a large square jaw, a visible sign of a determined, firm character (back then the pseudo-science of physiognomy was in vogue, and a firm sqaure jaw was a shore indication of a firm character).Has anyone ever heard of a handsome rich English lord going around and proposing to penniless American girls? Has anyone heard of an Italian count marrying a poor American woman? Now Mr. Osmond and Madam Merle: Has anyone ever heard of an American father threatening his daughter with penury and imprisonment in an Italian convent? Has anyone ever heard of an American woman calling herself Madam Merle... Madam?Henry James is the final product of mediocrity supported by everything money can buy. He has no originality; he is sophomoric at his best. In his eagerness to become an English gentleman he has forgotten what it means to be an American. \"The Portrait of a Lady,\" acclaimed as a classic and a masterpiece, is nothing but an empty puppet show.

      "['Krakauer\\'s book Under the Banner of Heaven has enough in it to disappoint everyone. It will disappoint, if not offend, Mormons and their sympathizers. It will also disappoint religious skeptics who long for substantial critiques of religious fundamentalism and the environments in which religious mania arises. If each of the book\\'s chapters were read as essays meant to stand on their own, each essay would provide a cogent analysis of some of the more interesting historical and contemporary accounts of the violence associated with Mormonism (and religion generally). The problem is the book was not written as a collection of loosely related essays but was written with the intent to weave a historical analysis from events in the recent past, all the way back to the mystical, if not fanciful, beginning of the Mormon religion.Krakauer starts by relating the story of two fundamentalist Mormons who murdered a young woman and her infant daughter because of some vaguely understood instruction on the part of God to do so. Krakauer alludes to, but does not explicitly reference, a version of Kant\\'s ontological fallacy: one can never disprove the claims of the murderers because they base their explanation, and admission, of their actions on divine instruction. In other words, Krakauer points out that you can\\'t refute the logic under which these murderers operated simply because they failed to operate under any logical system at all. Rather, they operated because \"it was the will of God\", to use the reductive and simplistic terms with which fundamentalists the world over justify their actions. In other words, to reduce an action to \"will of God\" is to absolve yourself of responsibility for that action; you state that God made you do it, and that there is no further discussion necessary. Therefore, Krakauer notes, the peculiar quality of fundamentalist religion is that it is impossible to critique in normal terms because fundamentalists are necessarily myopic in their perspective. God alone determines all things, they reason, so why consider another perspective? Thus we have a scene in which Krakauer interviews one of the murderers, and the murderer tells him in a blas&eacute; and banal manner that he did in fact commit murder and would do so again under similar circumstances.All of this points to the tension between the fundamentalist and the secular, modern world that Krakauer finds so poignant. But what of it? Where is the coherent narrative that connects these heinous murders to the origins of Mormonism? Krakauer would like to prove that the violent origins of Mormonism (which are very much tied up with the violent origins of the outlaw West of the 1800s) are somehow predictive of, and responsible for, the ultimate consequence: the murder of two innocent, defenseless people who did nothing worse than ignore the will of God. Krakauer certainly explains the lineage between modern-day Mormon fundamentalists and their ancestral polygamists. He certainly demonstratively proves the wanton abuse and manipulation of young girls and women at the hands of fundamentalist men in Mormonism, and notes quite correctly that this patriarchy is not exclusive to Mormons but rather rears its rapacious head in all fundamentalist religions, as well as some more mainstream ones.Krakauer\\'s fails to tie all of these points together. In general terms, Krakauer wants to prove that: (1) religious fundamentalism has its roots in mainstream religion, (2) religious fundamentalism is stultifying for those not in a position of authority, and (3) religious fundamentalism is based on an explicit rejection of any modern conception of the role of the state in regulating human affairs. Individually, Krakauer proves these points well. He demonstrates the lineage of Mormon fundamentalism to the original theological schism in Mormon dogma (which is the debate of polygamy and its legitimacy). He also demonstrates the venal and insidious way in which male authorities on fundamentalist communities humiliate, dictate, manipulate and destroy the lives of young girls and women. Finally, he demonstrates how incompatible fundamentalist thought is with the intellectual and political origins of the United States. In effect, Krakauer notes that fundamentalism and Jeffersonian-Lockean governments are ideologically opposed to one another. Since the role of the state is often in direct conflict with the will of God, Krakauer notes that many Mormon fundamentalists explicitly endorse defrauding the government and otherwise hewing to the lunatic fringe of the libertarian movement (not paying taxes, driving without license plates, etc.)Therefore, all of these ideas are explained well, in various chapters, and all of the chapters can stand alone as cogent analyses on problems at the intersection of fundamentalist religion and modern society. However, the narrative suffers because Krakauer does not quite pull all of these various themes together. The book jumps back and forth over the history of the Mormon Church and tries to relate current events to those of the recent past. While it is clear that the theological schism that afflicted the Mormon Church directly bears on the fact that there are polygamous Mormons living today, it does not explain the violence with which certain of these modern, polygamous people act. It is instructive to understand the violent origins of the world\\'s religions. It is interesting to draw parallels between historical and contemporary violence. It is tempting, further, to believe that the existence of these parallels proves a direct and necessary connection between historical occurrences and modern events. It is quite possible, even, that one can prove that the past necessarily predicts the present, but I don\\'t believe that Krakauer quite succeeded here.', \"Witty and authoritative, the World Encyclopaedia of Christmas is not only fun for casual reading but it has also served me well as a resourceful reference book.

This in turn will make you feel more comfortable when you hire a surveyor to meet an insurance requirement or to evaluate things you don't feel competent to do yourself.This book does a great job explaining how glass is laid up, the different types of glass, mat, roving, etc, and where they should be used. Common problems found in fiberglass boats such as blistering are discussed with lots of surprising information.I've found that my personal experiences confirmed many of the points made by the author. Like the myth that fresh water boats are better than salt water. Contrasted with fresh water boats are more likely to have blister problems than saltwater.Today, many people come to me with questions about boats. As I write this review, I realize that many of the answers I give out come out of information I found in this book.I don't believe you have to have a survey on a boat to make an intelligent purchase decision. In part, because some of the surveyors are only interested in your money, and do not look boats over thoroughly. A properly educated individual can do most or all of his, or her, own survey.Some surveyors are very good, and some are very bad. How can you tell if someone is good or not?To become a surveyor some certifying organizations only require a couple of sample copies of surveys done and that you have a few books on your bookshelf. What a joke!I personally know of a real case, which happened in 1999, where an old survey was pulled up, the date changed and it was reused without any a new survey being actually done. This is a good reason to choose your own surveyor and not the one recommended by the seller.Going aloft and checking the rigging on a boat is not easy. Is it not surprising that important steps like these get skipped.Some surveyor's haven't read this book--so how good can they be? Contrast this with someone who has taken a 8 week course on surveying, holds a USCG license, and grew up on boats. This is the kind of person you want for a surveyor.It is up to you to be knowledgeable enough to make your own decisions-including choosing a surveyor if you feel you need one. This book will help you do that.Educate yourself. Being able to look a boat over to evaluate it for purchase is an important skill. This book is a good starting point.

Yet that is exactly what this so-called dictionary attempts to do; promote ignorance and slanderous lies (when it\\'s not simply providing partial truths).The authors clearly did NOT research the occult or much about the other religious groups they write about. Not only do they repeatedly credit Satanism for beliefs completely unrelated to that Sect, but they mutilate any respectable definition of the peace sign -- calling it the \"Satanists Pentacle\" (when penta is the prefix meaning \"five\" and there are no five points inside a peace sign).Regarding the Wiccan Rede -- the authors erroneously attribute it to Aleister Crowley who had NOTHING to do with either Wicca or with the Rede, as an ethical principle that\\'s regularly drummed around many neo-pagan circles. Many would argue Crowley had nothing to do with ethics at all. In fact, he purported \"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole law\" (feel like having sex with your neighbor\\'s infant? Do it!) while the Wiccan Rede states \"An it harm none, do what ye will.\" The authors also falsely claim that Satanists follow the Rede, when they are not at all compelled by Wiccan dogma, but (according to the Satanist Bible) follow their own rules to do whatever\\'s the OPPOSITE of Christianity.The two examples, provided above, are but the tip of the iceberg for how inaccurate is this dictionary.

It boils down to an opinions spitting war. Hopefully that will not happen here.If you are interested in the lives and eccentricities of polygamists, their bizarre behavior and their propensity to violence in defending their beliefs then this book will offer some enlightenment.I read the book specifically to find out more about Dan Lafferty and the murder of his sister-in-law and niece. I wanted to read the interviews that Krakauer had had with Lafferty and to get a better understanding as to how such heinous crimes could be perpetrated against members of the Lafferty family--Dan's own extended family-- in the name of religion. The book was informative from that standpoint.But if you think that this book will give you the supposed inside story of the dark side of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons) you are sadly mistaken.In the first place, none of the fundamentalists interviewed by Krakauer are members of the LDS Church. Since the late 1800's all individuals practicing polygamy and, more importantly, given to views and teachings that are inflammatory and contrary to those accepted by the LDS Church are summarily excommunicated. Moreover, Dan Lafferty--even in the Krakauer interviews--admits that he is not a member of the LDS Church and that his beliefs depart dramatically from anything the LDS Church teaches.In the second place, Krakauer's supposed research is riddled with references to the works of individuals like Fawn Brodie--an avowed nonobjective enemy of the LDS faith who wasted her life away writing unbelievable drivel about the Church's origins for decades. Mind you, she didn't stop with insubtantiable rubbish about Mormonism. She also wrote a landmark series of books about America's Founding Fathers that painted them as nothing more than a lecherous bunch of womanizers who just got lucky when it came to democracy. Brodie's reverse chauvinism is as transparent as water and the chip on her shoulder all too evident.If you are interested in historic facts regarding The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints read Leonard Arrington's excellent biography of Brigham Young, American Moses. It provides a fair narrative of many of the events included in Krakauer's book--information terribly twisted and misrepresented, I might add.If you want to read this book in order to look at radical religious fundamentalism, especially the tragic events centering on Dan Lafferty and his brother, Ron, then do so. But take Krakauer's supposed &quot;facts&quot; about The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-days Saints as what they are--nothing more than mean-spirited, small-minded hearsay.\", \"Promising start, but then it just got way complicated and Wilder turned into a lecherous pig, sleeping with Althea.

His father has passed away, and then a \"captain\" who has been staying with him in your father\\'s inn, leaves you with a treasure chest and map.Jim is a boy and is somewhat powerless.

Can Jim save the \"good\" crew, and the treasure?In the book, Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson, I was surprised when Long John Silver described his dangerous plan to his fellow pirates and that the \"time\" is near. There are a lot of parts where the book is told from a point of view, Jim and Dr. Livesey. This book is not a prequel, sequel, or part of a series. This book is a full out fight between good and evil and full of adventure. I would surly recommend this book to any boy interested in adventure and in Robert Louis Stevenson.', 'Francesca Lia Block in I Was A Teenage Fairy exhibits great suspense and realism throughout the novel. Mab, a fairy, introduces the element of fantasy, which inevitably leaves the reader hanging on to their seats grasping for more. With this fairy, Lia Block uses realism along with fantasy to create a familiar atmosphere. Her tremendous talent to bring out teen realism, makes the reader understand that the problems they are facing are the same all teens are going through. Lia Block can be considered a rebel for exploring the real issues of teens.Perhaps the greatest example of Lia Block\\'s talent is her use of fantasy in a dark world. She express a childhood activity of make-believe in a teenage life. \" Maybe Mab was real. Maybe she was the fury, the courage, the sex. Whatever Mab had been, now, joined with her tiny winged red-haired biscuit, Mab was the love, flying through night like an errant star that had longed to be know, even briefly, what made planet Earth\\'s children weep and sing.\" (Pg. 186, I Was A Teenage Fairy) It is through the fairy that the protagonist Barbie Marks can find herself and her true identity in the world. In her fantastic use of description, Lia Block brings the fantasy to life.Hence the fantasy mixed with realism is what gives the story character. Mab, the fantasy, and Barbie the realism, come together to help each other in their journeys of self- discovery and acceptance. \"Barbie was no longer afraid of anything. It was like that thing Mab had said about belief. The belief is sometimes the biggest part of it all. You can choose to believe in your published book being held in the loving hands of strangers, your name tattooed forever on the heart of the one you adore: you can choose to believe in tiny red-haired pesky piskies- all the things \"they\" may tell you not to believe in. But who are they anyway? What do they know? What makes them any more real? And now, Barbie realized , I am telling Mab to believe. I am telling Belief herself to believe.\" (Pg 179, I Was A Teenage Fairy) They bring out the truth in each other as they begin to understand, who they are is who they are. With this friendship, Lia Block captures the essence of childhood in a teenage world.Furthermore I Was A Teenage Fairy reflects the inner truth of issues all teens are forced to deal with. Parents, money, drugs, alcohol, and sex are clear in the life of a normal teen, however society has chose to ignore what is really going on in hopes that they aren\\'t present. Lia Block helps to clarify to all teens that the problems they are facing, are normal, and that it is ok to hold on to childhood imagination. She has become the light in an otherwise dark life in which some teens live in. They live in embarrassment and fear as the feel they are alone in the choices they make. Through this novel the reader is shown that the greatest asset of life is the uniqueness of your spirit and how each problem faced can be considered normal.', \"Finding Salliq is a wonderful, humorous, modern day, and refreshing story for the twenty to thirty-something crowd.

So no, there is no logical plot, but we get fun pictures and dazzling rhymes that we love.', 'As a big fan of the \\'literary lion\\' of the last century, I have read almost everything he wrote. This book came out 25 years after his death and shows a sensitive side to his writing never previously seen. \\'The Garden of Eden\\' is a twisted love triangle which actually gives the women characters in it a clear voice. He was always roundly criticized for the women characters in his stories being too one-dimensional. Not the case here. He himself described this novel as \"....the paradise a man must lose....\" This book is so far different in every aspect from his other works that it is worth the read on that basis alone. While I never read his other post-humous work \\'Islands in the Stream\\', I did manage to read \\'True at First Light.\\' Unfortunately, this manuscript should\\'ve remained \"lost.\" It was really just a biography of one of his last African safaris with his wife Mary rather than a novel.

I would call this &quot;Flashman Goes to Sea,&quot; since it has the same sort of ribald approach and a scoundrel hero who succeeds in spite of himself. Written by an American, the series, especially in the first few novels, has a distinctly American point of view. I read with interest the review from the writer who was critical of the &quot;homophobic&quot; bias of the author. While I'll admit that the protagonist, Lewrie, is a homophobe, this is not out of character for him, as he has suffered from the perfidies of his half-sibling, who is gay, and at the time he seems shocked and disgusted by his apparently homosexual superior officer, he is still shy of his 20th birthday. I, on the other hand, liked the descriptions of life aboard ship; the strong battle scenes; the fact that Lewrie is not the perfect little hero; and the glimpses of British Colonial life in both America and the West Indies. For anyone who likes naval fiction, I heartily recommend this series. I have just started the series by Patrick O'Brian, and the Lewrie books are far more &quot;modern&quot; and exciting, at least to me.\", 'the legend of sleepy hollow is a mystery story it made me feel exited.thisis a summery about it.just a ordanary man in a little town named ichabod crane. and he fell in love one day same as another named brom they both had a crush on the same girl named katriena . she danced with ihabod every night . then they got marryed. brom got enveous then he left ichabod out cold with his horse .

It was intriguing and interesting and kept me interested in all three books.', \"I checked this audio book out of the public library for a road trip several years ago, and was instantly hooked. I wore out the copy I made, and finally bought it. I listen to it regularly, with avidity, and have no idea when I'll get tired of it! Between each poem there is a pause of perhaps 30 seconds filled with intriguing noises, which allows you to dwell in the poem just read for a bit longer, while preparing you for the one to come-- a kind of aural sherbet between courses to freshen the mental palatte! The variety of poems-- modern, classic, metered, free verse, serious, witty; Garrison Keillor's melliflous voice and his sensitive interpretations, along with those marvelous sound-filled pauses between readings makes this particular collection an extremely pleasurable experience.\", 'Not really the best Christian apologetic Lewis ever wrote: that would be his 1960 revision of _Miracles: A Preliminary Study_, in conjunction with his much earlier _The Problem of Pain_ (which should be read after MaPS).Still, MC is very accessible to many readers. The chapters of the first two sections were originally designed to be \"Broadcast Talks\" (the original title of the first publication of the first section) on BBC radio during WWII. They provide a colorful version (if somewhat oversimplified, as Lewis well knew) of the theistic Argument from Morality, which does help to introduce the principles within and around the argument; and, for section 2, a variation of what has come to be called the Lewis Trilemma (aka \\'Liar, Lunatic, or Lord?\\').The Trilemma is also oversimplified (keep in mind the broad target audience), and should not be considered to be Lewis\\' ultimate opinion on the subject; but unfortunately he never seems to have written a more technical version. (Some even more foreshortened versions can be found in other articles and essays he wrote.) In any event, although it is tempting to deride Lewis for simply presuming that the texts are sufficiently accurate to make such a judgment, any critic (pro or con) ought to know from other writings that Lewis was well aware of the benefits and limitations (and abuses) of textual criticism. Besides, the attempt to call into question the honesty of the textual authors/editors merely ends up reinstituting the Trilemma again at the next level. The Trilemma cannot easily be brushed aside: as the increasingly complex (and spurious) historical revisionism theories of the past 30 years (forms of which Lewis was already familiar with from his own day and prior) ironically testify.This doesn\\'t mean that the Trilemma argument is rock-solid, either, however. It isn\\'t a substitute for preliminary philosophical argument; nor is it a substitute for historical analysis. It perhaps works best as the very tail end of one (or ideally both) of those endeavors. Dr. Gregory Boyd makes much the same point very well in _Cynic Sage or Son of God_ (an indepth analysis of the logical bona fides of various historical propositions): if Jesus was like _that_, then we have a fairly straightforward explanation for why the earliest existant texts about him are like _this_--an explanation that doesn\\'t require (for instance) hypothesizing about what a hypothetical community did not believe based on what a hypothetical \\'early strata\\' of a hypothetical document hypothesized to have been used by this hypothetical community does _not_ say. |g| (As Boyd pithly observes: _that_ requires faith! Lewis, who had already seen numerous similar attempts at historical revisionism in his day, even outside Jesus-studies, would agree.)As always, careful qualification should be observed, pro or con: and it is admittedly worth noting, that due to certain restrictions in his delivery, Lewis is not as carefully qualified as he could be. (i.e., this is a necessarily truncated _introduction_ to the topic, not the final word on it.)The AfM in Section 1, remember, is also not rigorously proposed. (Although it is more thorough than the chapter on morality in MaPS, again for a good reason in relation to the structure of that greater work.) Unfortunately, again, Lewis never wrote a rigorous (specifically theistic) AfM--possibly because he believed that no total weight would hang adequately on it (there is some indication of this in how he uses it to make a restrained and subordinate point in MaPS). _The Abolition of Man_ (and a few essays here and there which presage it) does not exactly take up the slack as a theistic AfM--although, once again, this is because Lewis didn\\'t design it to. (See my review of TAoM.)The remaining two sections (also originally published separately) form the majority of the book. The 3rd section, on \\'Christian Morality\\', is again a useful and enjoyable (if very basic) introduction to the subject, both at a theological and historical level, in the sense of: \\'This is the consistency of the subject in relation to Christian philosophy, and this is (a very basic) overview of how Christian thinkers have tended to most cogently consider the matter.\\'The final section, on the doctrine of the Trinity, is the best popular introduction to the subject I know.Both last sections (3 and 4) can work well at helping readers, both believer and sceptic, to clear away some misconceptions concerning those two topics (the generally-Christian moral code, and the trinitarian doctrine). Unfortunately, theories on those topics are widespread and different enough, that confusion may result if these are taken to be _the_ foundational base of understanding for future reading; especially in the case of the Trinity. Still, as aids to practical application of the relevant doctrines, they make excellent introductions.', \"First, don't read the introduction if you don't want to know what happens. Second, the author would skip many weeks (or months) at a time when it seemed that this timeframe was crucial to the story line. Such as when he returned from a 4-5 month absence. He had left his daughter to attend to the household and she was anxiously waiting for the day that he would return. It tells of him returning over the familiar hills and his thoughts. The next chapter he's been home for awhile and there is nothing about her reaction on his return. Also, the conflict between the father and daughter doesn't actual materialize significantly until your about three quarters of the way through. Some terms weren't familiar to me, such as croft, which made it a little slow going at the beginning. Otherwise, the writing itself was very descriptive and I guess this is what got him the Nobel prize.\", 'It seems very intuitive and provides a serious look at productivity.', 'My mother is 92 years young.

The dialogue is so authentic, and the stories may be read separately or simultaneously. Either way, the tales make one large story; the story of Robin Hood. The prologue doesn't ramble like some do, and it does well in explaining why Robin is outlawed. While the Sheriff is very serious and deadly, Robin tricks him so easily and merrily quick, but, like civil gentleman, makes sure not to over-annoy him.The illustrations are very detailed and authentic as well.From the back:The beloved adventures of Robin Hood come vividly to life in this wonderful illustrated version by Howard Pyle. Deep in Sherwood Forest, the legendary Robin Hood-the brave, good-humored outlaw- proves himself the best in England with his bow. Here are all the exciting tales of how Little John, Will Scarlet, Alan a Dale, and Friar Tuck joined his merry band of men...Robin Hood's breathtaking escapes from his arch enemy, the Sheriff of Nottingham...and one hilarious escapade after another, filled with quick action, scheming villains, and great surprises.

His elder brother, Darry, brings him up after the death of his parents in a car accident. Though Pony resents him, he is also in awe of him. He also idolizes his middle brother, Soda. All three brothers belong to a gang of poor teenagers called the Greasers, named for their long, oily hair. Their bitter rivals are the Socs, the rich kids living on the west side of town. Pony is involved in the murder of a Soc named Bob. After the killing, he runs away with his friend Johnny to Windrixville. There they hide in an abandoned church. When the church catches on fire, they bravely rescue some children trapped in it. Johnny is badly injured and has to be hospitalized. When he dies, Pony is completely shattered. He cannot reconcile himself to his friend\\'s death until he reads a letter Johnny has left for him telling him to \\'stay gold\\' and to continue appreciating sunsets. He finally understands that with hard work he can overcome his circumstances and not remain an outsider all his life. Pony then adopts a mission for himself to tell the rest of the world about the odds that under-privileged children have to face. He also realizes and appreciates how much Darry loves and cares for him.Johnny Cade - a member of the Greasers whom the other gang members try to protect. His father constantly beats him up, and his mother either ignores his presence or screams at him. He becomes a nervous wreck after he is terribly beaten up by the Socs. He starts carrying a switchblade in his pocket; when he and Pony are attacked by the Socs, he uses the knife to kill Bob in self-defense. He hides with Pony in an abandoned church in Windrixville and heroically rescues children who are trapped in the church after it catches fire. During the rescue, a burning beam falls on his back, and he later dies in a hospital. Before dying, he tells Dally that \\'fighting\\'s no good\\' and asks Pony to \\'stay gold.\\' Even after death, his spirit reaches out to Pony in the form of a letter which he leaves for him, exhorting him to remain pure and rise above being an outsider. The letter motivates Pony to tell the rest of the world that it is wrong to judge children by the amount of hair oil they wear.Dallas Winston (Dally) - the toughest, coldest, and meanest of the Greasers. He has been in and out of jail since the age of ten. He gives Pony and Johnny a gun and some money when they come to him after Bob\\'s death. He also tells them where to hide. During the rescue, Dally plunges into the burning church to rescue Johnny, who is trapped under a beam. Upset by Johnny\\'s death, he threatens the police with an unloaded gun after robbing a store. He dies without the world knowing about his qualities or the reasons for his delinquency.SETTINGThe Outsiders is set in a large, unnamed town in the United States. It is about a gang of teenage boys who are called the Greasers. They live on the east side of the town, also known as the wrong side of town; the eastside neighborhood is described in graphic detail. The story is set in the 1960\\'s and relates the incidents that take place over a few days. After killing Bob, Pony and Johnny take shelter in an abandoned church in Windrixville. After it catches fire and burns down, they return to their hometown, where Johnny dies in a hospital.CONFLICTProtagonistPony Curtis is the teenage narrator and protagonist of the novel. When his parents were killed in a car accident, Darry, his twenty- year-old brother, began to provide for him. He resents Darry\\'s bullying manner, not realizing that he does so because he loves him and wants him to make something of himself. Pony belongs to an eastside gang of poor teenagers, called the Greasers; their rivals are the Socs, the rich kids living on the west side of town.AntagonistPony\\'s antagonist is his status in life. Poor and from the wrong side of town, he gets no breaks in life, even though he is a good student and studies hard. He joins the Greasers because it is the thing to do if you live on the east side of town. Their rivals are the Socs, a gang of rich, spoiled kids living on the west side of town. The Socs constantly pick fights with the Greasers, and Bob, one of the Socs, attacks Johnny and Pony because they have been friendly with Cherry. Johnny kills Bob in self-defense, and he and Pony go into hiding in a church in Windrixville. When the church catches on fire, Johnny and Pony try to save the children trapped inside. Johnny is serious injured during the rescue and dies a few days later in a hospital. Dally, who was Johnny\\'s best friend, is completely shattered by his death. Crazy with grief, he robs a store and then threatens the police with an unloaded gun. As a result, he is killed. Now Pony has lost two friends. He falls sick, becomes delirious, tries to deny Johnny\\'s death, and begins to fail in school.ClimaxThe climax occurs when Pony reads the letter that Johnny has written to him before his death. Johnny encourages his friend to \"stay gold\" - to look for the sunsets and good things in life. He tells Pony that if he tries, he will be able to make something worthwhile out of his life. Reading the letter is the turning point in Pony\\'s life.OutcomeThe novel ends as a tragic comedy. Even though Bob, Johnny, and Dally have needlessly perished, Pony overcomes his problems, largely due to Johnny\\'s letter of encouragement. He reconciles with Darry, finally understanding how much his older brother loves and cares for him. He also accepts that he does not have to be an outsider or a Greaser for the rest of his life. In order to seek help and understanding for underprivileged children like himself, Pony\\'s mission becomes to tell others about the immense obstacles that stand in the way of success for teenagers from the wrong side of town. The novel, therefore, ends on a note of hope and optimism.PLOTPony Curtis is a member of the Greasers, a gang of poor teenagers with long, oily hair and from the wrong side of town. While returning home from the movies one night, Pony is attacked by the Socs, a gang of rich kids from the west side of town. Pony is afraid that they are going to kill him and starts shouting for help. His brothers (Darry and Soda), along with Steve Randle, Two Bit Matthews, Dally Winston, and Johnny Cade, rush to his rescue. After ascertaining that Pony is relatively unharmed, Darry shouts at him for walking alone and tells him that he should use a bit of common sense. Darry is Pony\\'s oldest brother who has provided for him since his parents were killed in a car accident. Darry knows that Pony is smart and wants him to do well in life. As a result, he constantly nags Pony about doing well in school and making good grades. Pony resents his brother\\'s intrusion in his life and his unemotional ways. In contrast, Pony adores Soda, his middle brother. He is a high school dropout, who works at a gas station with his best friend Steve Randal. Two-Bit Matthews is a member of the Greasers who always tries to have the last word on things. Johnny Cade is another gang member whom everyone tries to protect, because his father constantly tries to beat him up. The toughest character of the Greaser\\'s gang is Dally, who has been in and out of jail since the age of ten. Pony, Johnny, and Dally decide to go to the drive-in the next evening. There they meet Cherry and Marcia, friends of the Socs. Dally is rude and obnoxious. When Cherry throws a coke in his face, he stalks off in anger. Pony and Johnny are left to watch the movie with the girls, but they are soon joined by Two Bits. After the movie they decide to walk to Two Bits\\' house to pick up his car in order to take the girls home. Along the way, Pony and Cherry find that they have a lot in common; they are both are idealistic dreamers, who love sunsets. Suddenly a blue Mustang pulls up near them. Two members of the Socs, Bob and Randy, emerge from the car to confront them. A fight almost takes place between the boys, but Cherry prevents it by getting into the Mustang.Two-Bit goes off to play snooker, and Pony and Johnny go to the vacant lot where they often hang out. At about two-thirty in the morning, Pony gets up with a start, for he has fallen asleep in the vacant lot. He rushes home to find Darry awake and frantic with worry. He shouts at Pony, which results in an argument. When Darry slaps his younger brother, Pony rushes out of the house and finds Johnny. As they walk in the park, Bob, Randy, and several other Socs attack them for being with their girls earlier. In the fight that follows, Johnny, in self-defense, kills Bob with his switchblade.In a panic, Johnny and Pony go to Dally for help. He gives them a loaded gun, money, and directions to reach an abandoned church in Windrixville, where they can hide out. They change their appearance by cutting off their long hair and pass the time by reading Gone with the Wind and discussing life. Once Pony recites one of Robert Frost\\'s poems, \"Nothing Gold Can Stay.\" Johnny understands that \"gold\" in the poem stands for freshness, innocence, and purity.On the fifth day of their hiding, Dally comes to visit Pony and Johnny. He takes them out to eat and informs them that the tension between the Socs and the Greasers has increased. A rumble between the two gangs is supposedly to take place the following evening. Dally says that he has started carrying an unloaded gun to serve as a deterrent to any serious trouble. Johnny announces his decision to turn himself in to the police, for he does not want to be on the run for the rest of his life. He believes that he will get a light sentence since he has killed Bob in self-defense. Dally tries to dissuade him; he knows first-hand that any prison time is miserable.THEMESMajorThe major theme of the novel revolves around the purposelessness of any gang of teenagers. The book centers on the foolish gang rivalry existing between the Socs, the rich kids from the west side of town, and the Greasers, the poor kids from the east side.Pony, the protagonist of the story, is bitter about the fact that the wealthy Socs have nice cars, fancy clothes, and girlfriends; things are simply easier for them than for the Greasers. Because the Socs are convinced that they are better, they constantly pick on members of the Greasers, who fight back. During one squabble, Bob, one of the Socs, is murdered by Johnny in self-defense. Then Johnny, while hiding out in a church, is killed while trying to rescue children from the burning building. In reaction to Johnny\\'s death, Dally, his best friend, goes on a rampage. He robs a store and points an unloaded gun at the police; as a result, he is shot and killed. Because of the needless gang fighting, three teenagers are killed in the novel, clearly pointing out the negative aspect of belonging to a gang. Hinton is obviously trying to warn the reader against participation in any gang.MinorRelated to the major theme of the book is the theme that a teenager can rise above his circumstances through hard work, patience, and determination. Pony is the proof of this theme. Even though he is born into poverty, loses his parents in a car accident at an early age, and participates in the Greasers, by the end of the book, he is determined to better his plight in life, largely due to the encouragement he receives from the deceased Johnny in a letter. At the close of the novel, Pony wants to tell the world that underprivileged children need to have some breaks in order to get ahead and need to be judged for who they are, not by how they look or how they dress. Hinton definitely convinces the reader that Pony, because of his intelligence and determination, will rise above the poverty and gang life that he was born into.MOODWhen the story opens, the mood is bitter and rebellious. Pony and the other Greasers resent the fact that the Socs have lots of money, nice cars, fancy clothes, and many girlfriends. In contrast, they are poor and must work extremely hard for everything they have. In addition, society is prejudiced against them because of their clothes, long hair, and greasy appearance. In the middle of the novel, the mood becomes increasingly angry. The Greasers are tired of the Socs always picking on them, and the Socs are furious about the Greasers hanging out with some of \"their girls.\" As a result, the Socs jump Pony and Johnny. In self-defense Johnny kills Bob, one of the Socs. The mood then becomes one of terror. Pony and Johnny are scared for their own safety and fear the police. Upon Dally\\'s advice, they hide in an abandoned church and worry about being found. The mood then switches to great sadness, for Johnny, in trying to rescue the children when the church catches on fire, is killed himself. Dally then gets himself foolishly shot by the police, leaving Pony with two less friends. By the end of the novel, however, the mood has some degree of hope. Pony is determined to rise above his past. He adopts a new mission in life, to tell the world about the problems and deprivations of underprivileged children, like himself. It is obvious that in the end, Hinton is very sympathetic towards the plight of Pony and the Greasers.', \"Accurately portrayed teen angst is the key to R&J;, and Shakespeare knocked it out of the park with this one. If one reads this play closely they will find the gorgeous poetry and subtle humor and vulgarity pleasing, but what is more pleasing to the mature reader is the acute portrayal of teens who think they are in love. This must have been the go to teen reference of its day. There is locker room talk between Romeo and his buddies, especially Mercutio. (Mercutio is one of Shakespeare's dirtiest characters, and one of his wittiest.) There is the horny teenager who flits from lust to lust with no thought of consequences, and there is the young girl who makes a serious attempt at very adult decisions. It is all there, and what is more the supporting cast of this play boasts some real genius of character. Lord Capulet is a ferocious father, who has a powerful temper and spirit, and Friar Laurence is one of Shakespeare's most ambiguously motivated characters.One can read this play on the surface level and certainly enjoy it. I think most readers do just that. As do most of the productions I have seen. But there is a dark undercurrent to this play that will ring true with anyone who has ever dealt with that most powerful of emotions. Love.Like Shakespeare's best, R&J; will continue to yield new discoveries on each reading. As we mature in our lives, so does our understanding and appreciation of this play.\", \"Like Water for Chocolate is a fascinating love story set in Mexico during the Revolution. It contains fantasy elements, familial love, passionate romance, food, and tragedy. Mama Elena is a controlling mother, and her three daughters, Tita, Rosaura, and Gertrudis struggle against her for their own love and freedom. The home, like the country, holds all the elements of humanity, as each person longs to exist, and find love and happiness in their own lives. Yet, when Pedro marries Rosaura and comes into the family, Tita finds that his love for her is still true, and dreams that he will finally be united with her. Tita, who was born in the kitchen, cannot betray her sister, Rosaura, so she immerses herself in cooking to quell her desire for her first love, Pedro. When she finally rebels against Mama Elena's domination, she finds acceptance from Dr. Brown, a kind and understanding man who also loves her. Although Tita begins to see where her happiness lies, her passion consumes her in the end. The delicious recipes for the typical Mexican food, may whet your appetite, but the amounts of ingredients are mostly incredible.\", 'When i recieved the book krik krak i thought it was going to be very boring.

It is really sad. I read it with tears because back in 1969, my parents took my sister and I to visit Calumet, and I was extremely impressed as a horse-loving (and owning)teenager.One of the highlights of the trip was seeing 29 year old Citation. We also saw Needles, another Kentucky Derby winner who was standing at Calumet at the time, and I'm surprised no mention was made of him.The same day, we visited Leslie Comb ll's Spendthrift Farm that actually went belly up before Calumet, but not that long before.There, we saw Nashua, Swaps, Creme dela Creme, Sword Dancer, and Gallant Man. The lesson is that these are living, breathing creatures, not meant to be portfolios or their welfare put at the whim of human greed and avarice.I read the book wishing I could slap Lundy full in the face, and to this day, I fully believe he had a hand in Alydar's death because it would be to Lundy's advantage at the time to collect on the insurance. I am surprised that the Lloyd's of London didn't require a more extensive investigation before the payout was made, but they probably still believed in Calumet's peerless reputation, and a part of them didn't want to imagine anyone at Calumet would do anything like this.

The book is amazing.By: S.J.Los AngelesAge 5', \"This novel -- astonishing in its power, being Carson McCuller's first -- has justly come to be considered to be a classic of modern American literature. McCullers' creative prowess is breathtaking -- she has brought to life the 1930s American South, in a non-judgemental, gently-written yet cinematically focused style of prose that has few equals. Her characters spring to life with all of their beauty and warts intact, all of their despair and hope, all of their love and hate, all of their joy and pain and anger. The prejudice that existed (and, unfortunately, still exists in many places and hearts) -- against blacks, the poor, the uneducated, the politically radical -- is laid out before the reader in such a way as to allow us to make up our own minds about it.Each of the characters in this wonderful novel seems to inhabit their own private pocket of loneliness. There are those who dare to hope and dream -- chief among them the unforgettable Mick Kelly -- and they keep a tight rein on these hopes. McCullers brings this point home well on p. 199: '...by habit they shortened their thoughts so that they would not wander out into the darkness beyond tomorrow.'The story evolves into a languidly expanding, yet unstoppable diaspora of desperate, lonely people -- all of whom seem to have at least part of their hopes for life focused on Singer, the mute who is at the center of this work. The musical metaphors McCullers employs in Mick's life are brilliant in themselves -- but there are many brilliant things about this work, it is filled with them.McCullers is a great example of a talented artist whose life was much too short -- but she has left us with an astounding body of work of the highest quality.\", \"The Duke and I is a great book.

That alone stirs up many thought-provoking issues, like how an Asian American girl attempts to find her identity, or the similarities between Jewish and Asian Americans. That alone would have been enough. The problem is that Jen adds a lot more to her plot. A little too much maybe. On top of the Asian American issues, you've got your 70's zeitgeist, black American issues, hippies living in teepees, and generation gaps. It almost seems like Jen is making a bold attempt to create the Great American Novel--encompassing each and every ingredient of the Salad Bowl, aka America. But the book is so all-encompassing that Jen hardly gets truly in-depth into anything. The Jewish Asian girl premise is lost within the first fifty pages, and maintained periodically by half-heartedly throwing in a few Yiddish phrases through the rest of the novel. Because of it's broadness, this book does not bring up as many Asian American issues as one would hope. It's a worthy competitor for the Great American Novel title, but unfortunately, Jen isn't much of an established writer outside of the Asian American literture realm for her book to be considered for the GAN pool.\", 'The book, Illusions: The Adventures of A Reluctant Messiah, by Richard Bach is an absolutely amazing piece of writing.

You can click to the next page if you want to read the rest of the review.Here I'll add that it's an important book for another reason: between the lines, it makes a tremendous concession to non-Objectivist ethics.In the opening essay, on p. 24 of the current paperback edition, Rand acknowledges that there is such a thing as &quot;socially objective value&quot; -- her term for what Mises would have called _subjective_ value -- and says it is this kind of value that the free market serves.In the course of discussing this sort of value, Rand concedes (with her teeth gritted) that the values appropriate for what she called &quot;man _qua_ man_&quot; (and here defines as &quot;man at his best&quot;) just aren't appropriate for everybody.If this insight were followed up consistently, the whole Objectivist ethic would need to be revised from the ground up.

One of the few non-clerics to be recognised as a theologian by the Anglican church, he put forth the case for Christianity in general in ways that many Christians beyond the Anglican world can accept, and a clear description for non-Christians of what Christian faith and practice should be. Indeed, Lewis says in his introduction that this text (or indeed, hardly any other he produced) will help in deciding between Christian denominations. While he describes himself as a \\'very ordinary layman\\' in the Church of England, he looks to the broader picture of Christianity, particularly for those who have little or no background. The discussion of division points rarely wins a convert, Lewis observed, and so he leaves the issues of ecclesiology and high theology differences to \\'experts\\'. Lewis is of course selling himself short in this regard, but it helps to reinforce his point.This collection contains several of C.S. Lewis\\' classic works (although it is not in fact a complete collection of all his writings, not even of all his non-fiction writings). It contains the following works: \\'Mere Christianity\\', \\'The Screwtape Letters\\', \\'The Great Divorce\\', \\'The Problem of Pain\\', \\'Miracles\\', \\'A Grief Observed\\', plus \\'The Abolition of Man\\'. It does provide an excellent survey of Lewis\\' theology, ethics, and general outlook on life. I will highlight two of the selections that show the different ways Lewis approaches things.For the first example, the book \\'Mere Christianity\\' looks at beliefs, both from a \\'natural\\' standpoint as well as a scripture/tradition/reason standpoint. Lewis looks both at belief and unbelief - for example, he states that Christians do not have to see other religions of the world as thoroughly wrong; on the other hand, to be an atheist requires (in Lewis\\' estimation) that one view religions, all religions, as founded on a mistake. Lewis probably surprised his listeners by starting a statement, \\'When I was an atheist...\\' Lewis is a late-comer to Christianity (most Anglicans in England were cradle-Anglicans). Thus Lewis can speak with the authority of one having deliberately chosen and found Christianity, rather than one who by accident of birth never knew any other (although the case can be made that Lewis was certainly raised in a culture dominated by Christendom).Lewis also looks at practice - here we are not talking about liturgical niceties or even general church-y practices, but rather the broad strokes of Christian practice - issues of morality, forgiveness, charity, hope and faith. Faith actually has two chapters - one in the more common use of system of belief, but the other in a more subtle, spiritual way. Lewis states in the second chapter that should readers get lost, they should just skip the chapter - while many parts of Christianity will be accessible and intelligible to non-Christians, some things cannot be understood from the outside. This is the `leave it to God\\' sense of faith, that is in many ways more of a gift or grace from God than a skill to be developed.Finally, Lewis looks at personality, not just in the sense of our individual personality, but our status as persons and of God\\'s own personality. Lewis\\' conclusion that there is no true personality apart from God\\'s is somewhat disquieting; Lewis contrasts Christianity with itself in saying that it is both easy and hard at the same time. Lewis looks for the `new man\\' to be a creature in complete submission and abandonment to God. This is a turn both easy and difficult.\\'Mere Christianity\\' was originally a series of radio talks, published as three separate books - \\'The Case for Christianity\\', \\'Christian Behaviour\\', and \\'Beyond Personality\\'. This book brings together all three texts. Lewis\\' style is witty and engaging, the kind of writing that indeed lives to be read aloud. Lewis debates whether or not it was a good idea to leave the oral-language aspects in the written text (given that the tools for emphasis in written language are different); I think the correct choice was made.On the other hand, Lewis can write in ways that are intensely personal and reflective. This is true of the book \\'A Grief Observed\\'. This was drawn out of his personal experience with his wife, Joy. C.S. Lewis was a confirmed bachelor (not that he was a \\'confirmed bachelor\\', mind you, just that he had become set enough in his ways over time that he no longer held out the prospect of marriage or relationships). Then, into his comfortable existence, a special woman, Joy Davidson, arrived. They fell in love quickly, and had a brief marriage of only a few years, when Joy died of cancer.This left Lewis inconsolable.For his mother had also died of cancer, when he was very young.Cancer, cancer, cancer!Lewis goes through a dramatic period of grief, from which he never truly recovers (according to the essayist Chad Walsh, who writes a postscript to Lewis\\' book). He died a few years later, the same day as the assassination of John F. Kennedy.However, Lewis takes the wonderful and dramatic step of writing down his grief to share with others. The fits and starts, the anger, the reconciliation, the pain--all is laid bare for the reader to experience. So high a cost for insight is what true spirituality requires. An awful, awe-ful cost and experience.\\'Did you know, dear, how much you took away with you when you left? You have stripped me even of my past...\\'All that was good paled in comparison to the loss. How can anything be good again? This is such an honest human feeling, that even the past is no longer what is was in relation to the new reality of being alone again.In the end, Lewis reaches a bit of a reconciliation with his feelings, and with God.\\'How wicked it would be, if we could, to call the dead back. She said not to me, but to the chaplain, \"I am at peace with God.\" \\'Lewis had a comfortable, routine life that was jolted by love, and then devasted by loss.

Melvin Ely combines a professor's concern for factualness with thorough, ground-breaking research and a novelist's way with narrative into an unfailingly entertaining work that is also of great and lasting academic, social and cultural importance. Ely has delivered a fascinating show business yarn with absorbing insight into human nature, sometimes noble, often naive, and occasionally downright repugnant. While not afraid to add an edge of attitude or a clear point of view when he chooses, the author still eschews easy answers and the predictable pedantics and prejudice of an ideologue of any political persuasion. With subtle surety, and never a trace of condescension, Ely ultimately shows us ourselves--good, bad and ugly--in an absorbing saga of American life and culture.\", 'Barbara Kingsolver continues to amaze me.

The writing is not as others say horrible, as a reader who reads books by Tom Clancy, Steinback, Anne Rice, and Louis La'mour and others i must say that these book rate very high on the in-depth reading level that all the author's i mentioned portray. The series starts out with Rayford Steele a Airline pilot flying a routine flight when 80% of his crew and passengers disappear. This is teh rapture. All i can say is that from their the story is amazing. I was a non christin and i still have issues that keep me form coming a die hard christin. I do believe in god, and the rapture but do not believe certain things in the bible. This book on a non christian level opens the mind to the possiblity of the rapture actually occuring and hell even if you dont really believe it makes for a great fictionious novel. On a christian level the meaning and truth of this series is there. All i can say is give this book a chance, and dont read it with a closed mind. If i picked it up expecting another lame &quot;bible&quot; based book i would have hated it. But it was read with intuition and curiousity that just made it exciting.

      "['This was a wonderful book; one that I needed to read given my questions concerning God and His role in our lives. I also needed to read this book to determine how it is that the Church continues to spread the word of God given that the Church is organized and run by man. Man, inherently, because of the fall of Adam, is prone to sin. So how is it that the Church, run by man, who is prone to sin, can be the one organization to espouse the \"truth\" of God and His Son, Jesus?The first aspect of this book that I really enjoyed was that Father Sheed takes some very complicated topics and puts them into plain English so that the lay person can understand them. Father Sheed\\'s explanation of the trinity, one of the most complicated aspects of the Catholic Religion (in my opinion), was explained in a most wonderful way. It was explained so that I could understand it and without all the \"religious\" terminology that usually accompanies such explanations.The second aspect of the book that I enjoyed was the organization. He takes these issues from step one and then logically continues with the book up to the end. He takes the prior steps and incorporates them into later steps and wonderfully demonstrates how they all fit together.The third aspect of this book I loved was the explanation of why Jesus \"lowered\" himself to human form. Father Sheed had a wonderful way of explaining why is it was that Jesus came to do what he did. He ties this in with the fall of Adam and how the fall of Adam severed our relationship with God. Father Sheed also explains what \"original sin\" is and why we have it. It is not that the person born has sinned but has the sin of Adam just because we are human. Because of the fall, man was severed with God but Jesus came to \"bridge\" that gap and that is what he did.Do not get the idea that the \"sanity\" part of the book title means that if you don\\'t live the Catholic Way perfectly that one is insane. This is not what that term means in the context of the book. Sanity means seeing the world as it really is; not deceiving ourselves that the world is differnt that it really is. If we can do that, then we are seeing things correctly and have \"sanity\". However, not seeing the world and God as they truly are does not mean you are insane, in the mental aspect of the word. Father Sheed gives us a good idea what it means to not see things as they really are and how to change that in our lives.This is a wonderful book. However, this did take me a long time to read. Father Sheed has much to say and it is all something that you must think about to fully understand what he is saying. You cannot read this book like a fiction novel; you can\\'t or you will miss much of what Fr. Sheed is saying. It will take time but the time is well worth it.I have already purchased two more of Fr. Sheed\\'s books and I look forward to reading them.If you have an interest in learning more about the Catholic, or even just the Christian faith in plain English, then I cannot recommend this book highly enough. It certainly has helped me along in my own search on God and the role He plays in our lives.Enjoy!', \"I currently own seven guitars. I tried repairing/restoring an old, cheap guitar a few years back and ending up with a pile of worthless junk.Since purchasing this book all my remaining guitars sound better than ever. My first undertaking after reading this book was the restoration of my first guitar bought new 1965. Its plays like it was new and looks better than it has in years (many years). I have since used this book as my guide to a Gibson Les Paul restoration, a Yamaha BB1200S restoration, clean-up & set-up up on a couple vintage guitars, and was confident enough to do the setup an a new Gretsch I purchase a couple months ago.I have done setup and cosmetic work on two friends' guitars as well.This book has paid for itself many times over.\", \"In this book, Michelle Mitchell clears up one of the biggest misconceptions about the 18-35 year old crowd. Too often they are written off as self-indulgent, tuned out brats. Mitchell makes the compelling case that what is often perceived as cynicism is really just healthy skepticism.After all, this is a generation that has been marketed to and spun for their entire lives. No wonder they want to know the facts and judge for themselves.She also makes a stong case that what this generation needs more than anything else from their political leaders is authenticity. They want someone who will tell them the truth, even if it is unpleasant and then lay out a compelling vision as to how to approach the problem, an approach that includes a role for them. Until such a person comes along, this generation will be perfectly content to satisfy their political urges in local direct action and forego much activity on the national political scene.If what you do isn't going to make a difference, then why bother playing that game? Why not play a game that show immediate results, seems to be the attitude.All in all, this is an enjoyable read that is filled with insight for anyone who hopes to reach this increasingly important demographic block of voters.\", 'My mother borrowed this book from her aunt and read it. When I was about 10 she borrowed it again and I read it. When my first grand daughter was 10 I bought her a copy and she read it. It is a timeless book.', 'Very insightful and fun.

The Great Divorce was something of a different nature. Lewis still had his ideas about heaven and hell, but they were a bit more obvious. There weren't a lot of undertones as in the children series, but everything he wrote was concrete and it was obvious what his views were. This made the book a lot better and I enjoyed it very much especailly the ending, showing Lewis' rather cruel humor and sense of style. If anyone likes Lewis I recommend this book and I would also recommend The Screwtape Letters. Then if you enjoyed Screwtape I would recommend This Present Darkness and it's sequel Piercing the Darkness by Frank Peretti.\", \"These days it's really hard to find trading books that are as practical and simple to understand as this one.

This book is about a boy named Alex Rider who is a spy for an agency in England called M16. He has already saved the world twice before his 15th birthday. This time Alex was sent to spy on an old Russian general named Sarov. Enough uranium to create a nuclear bomb that would destroy an entire country was recently purchased by Sarov. Alex went to spy on him and got captured. Sarov's plan was to detonate the bomb by four old submarines that hold 1/5 of the world's uranium supply. This would then cause about triple the amount of damage. After the bomb detonated, Sarov would bring Russia back to the old days when it was a war country and had much power in the world. Alex had to stop this from happening at all costs. Alex defuses the bomb and saves the world for the third time. He then heads off to visit his friend in the South of F France.I recommend this book to almost anyone.

WORDING, BUT THE BOOK AS A WHOLE IS A MASTERPIECE.', \"Though Wuthering Heights was well-written and captivating, the plot line left a bit to be desired. The love, lust, revenge, and hatred all added up to a story resembling a soap opera. While the novel did present a powerful love story, it was one that fueled manipulative plots of revenge. Even so, the book was enjoyable. But eventually, the positive aspects of the novel were overshadowed and it became difficult to continue reading because of the layered plot. Bronte was a great writer, but her characters were merely two-dimensional entities whose goals in life were the direct result of love or hate. The story seemed somewhat unrealistic, simply because the characters seemed to represent extremes. So, while Wuthering Heights was very well-written, it didn't keep my interest. So I give it a rating a little above average.\", 'I\\'ll start off by saying that I\\'ve read all but 2 of Kurt Vonnegut\\'s works. This was one of the first that I read and to this day it remains my favorite. As a matter of fact, it\\'s probably one of my \"all time top 3.\" In \"Slaughterhouse Five\" Vonnegut somehow manages to tell a story that is simultaneously quasi-sci-fi, psychological, funny, and a deep study of human morals. It\\'s a book that will have you laughing most of the time while you read it, then somber when you think back on it as a whole. It manages to get across the anti-war morals that Vonnegut feels, but NEVER gets preachy or heavy-handed.I don\\'t want to ruin any of plot (and you can see descriptions anyway) so I\\'m not going to bother to delve into it. I\\'ll just say that this is a once-in-a-generation type of book and it\\'s a quick read too, so you owe it to yourself to give it a shot', \"Morgan Llywelyn has done it again with this wonderful book.

It is a book every young and old American should read to learn what could easily happen to their civilization or rather what is happening. George Orwell is acting as a visionary in telling a story that is becoming reality more each day. It is frightening to think if the government in our society is not stopped they can become equally as corrupt as the Party in Oceania. The thought that the government not only controls what you are doing each day, but also controls how you think is terrifying.The brilliant novel kicks off with Winston Smith, a member of the Party, climbing up flights of stairs with his throbbing varicose ulcer aching. The thirty-nine year old goes through his life second guessing the Party and all it stands for. Winston starts by recording his thoughts in a diary. After reviewing his thoughts he even wondered if he himself was indeed a lunatic. Through the book he is running from the dreaded Thought Police. Winston became involved with Julia another enemy of Big Brother. They met up secretly in multiple hiding spots. There they exchanged words about their combined hatred for the Party which followed with romantic pleasantries between the two. Inevitably the two are captured and brought to the Ministry of Love where their minds were molded into the stupid followers of the Party. At the conclusion Winston gives his soul up to the Party.This is a must read for all individuals. Even though written as a fiction novel the story 1984, can be linked to parts of today's society despite the fact that the year itself has since passed. The way the novel is able to draw in readers and immediately involve them in what events are occurring in the novel, is simply mind boggling. I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a sense of excitement for the book they are reading.\", 'Good wizard and dwarf yarn for people that enjoy far out and magic of another world.

I remember thinking how clever and profound of her to describe in a passage not the landscape of New Mexico, but &quot;the sky, the sky!&quot;Everything about about this book is beautiful.\", 'Random House, calling on English Professors and other literary professionals, declared James Joyce\\'s Ulysses as the greatest novel of the 20th Century.Who am I to disagree?While I may not have too many initials following my name, I\\'d like to believe that my opinion about Ulysses is valid in its own right. After all, I have taken the trouble to read the thing. Also, I have a bachelor\\'s degree, and have taught High School English. I\\'ve also read an exegesis of Ulysses, and am currently reading Finnegans Wake, so I do have something in the way of qualifications. At heart, I account my opposing opinion to the fact that I believe that the standards that I use to judge the merits of a novel are different than those employed by the fellows at Random House. Further, I think that my criteria aren\\'t necessarily all that bad.Indeed, I like to believe that my criteria are probably closer to what most people look for in a novel.The things that I look for in a novel include: an exciting plot; memorable, interesting characters; clean, crisp writing.The things that I believe the Random House voters look for in a novel include: intricate word play; obscure literary allusion/allegory; originality in form and syntax, even to the point of obfuscation.Ulysses certainly is a winner in the second category, as all eight hundred pages of it concern one man on one day in his life. Most of those pages are devoted to word play, literary allusions, experiments in literary form, etc. What Ulysses does not spend a lot of time on, however, is developing plot and character--the things I love in a good book. There is almost no clean, crisp writing to be found--Joyce\\'s primary consideration was not to be understood; he wanted to be *clever*.For instance, take the \"word overture.\" At the beginning of the \"Siren section,\" (Ulysses is modeled after The Odyssey), Joyce mirrors the overture of a musical by running together out-of-context fragments and snatches of words from the chapter to come. He does this without preamble or explanation and reading it is a very confusing experience. But Joyce didn\\'t write it with the intention of being clear--he had something artistic to say, or something experimental to try, or something like that. Please understand that this makes Joyce very, very different from most of the masters who preceeded him, such as Thomas Hardy, Leo Tolstoy, Charles Dickens, Victor Hugo, etc. They wrote in an effort to communicate themselves very clearly; Joyce wants to be difficult. They wanted to write interesting stories, Joyce wants something altogether different.For myself, I neither like Joyce\\'s style nor his intentions. I honestly cannot figure out the point, other than cleverness for cleverness\\' sake. Further, I believe that his method, which has become the main literary aesthetic in schools (which is why they all concentrate so much on literary devices such as metaphor and allegory), has been detrimental to education. By turning literature from entertaining stories into puzzle solving, I believe he has turned many children away from reading. I think this helps to account for, say, J.K. Rowling\\'s success. It\\'s not that kids don\\'t like to read, it\\'s that they don\\'t like to read things like Ulysses or similar efforts by Joyce\\'s admirers.Many people reading this will likely disagree with me. They think that Joyce was a \"genius.\" That\\'s fine--they\\'re entitled to their opinions. But, I\\'m entitled to mine as well, and, in my opinion, Ulysses does not say nearly enough of importance to be worth all the trouble it is to decode, and in the end it is simply not a lot of fun. In my opinion, there are tons of other books that have just as much of value (if not more), and *also* have exciting plots, interesting characters and clear writing. Joyce was, perhaps, a genius at puzzle-writing and encoding, but Ulysses is a poor novel.']\n",

However, George does a wonderful job of maintaining the flow within this patchwork epic. In some sense it feels as though you're reading the tablets themselves under his guidance and assistance. There is also a great introduction to basic Near East culture and history, as well as an interesting appendix on the creation of an ancient Babylonian translation. The illustrations are also interesting.Footnotes were nonexistent (though they were usually unnecessary--George has an introduction before every chapter). Also, the repetitive, partial fragments that George has translated after the epic are bit needless in an exoteric translation, though the poems were a nice touch.\", '... I reread Heart of Darkness because my \"guys\" reading group included two who had not ever read it. The story stands up far, far better than I would have guessed.

I had forgotten how subtle, how grown-up Conrad\\'s expectations of his reader are. Truly quite marvelous.With trepidation, I splurged on the Norton edition, even though I am pretty hostile to English-Professor post-modern posturing and nonsense. I am glad I got it, however. The wealth of historical documents help make the then-contemporary setting come real. The big surprise for me was Chinua Achebe\\'s fine essay.

The book is very heavy on spoken conversation (as contrasted with the implied, internal conversation characters tend to have in most successful books). Most of the conversation is the mushy, almost sickeningly-sweet dialogue one would expect from a newly in-love couple, but they follow through to the bedroom often. In short, there is not really a point to this book. It follows their `honeymoon' period in almost too much detail.That said, it's still an enjoyable book with likable characters. Just don't expect too much excitement, tension or angst. I've read it twice and enjoyed it both times.It's a true feel-good story.\", \"At first I was a little skeptical about this book because I thought it would be kind of a 'la de da' book (e.g. &quot;Little Women&quot;). Well, I was wrong, and now Anne Rice has become my absolute favorite author.In &quot;Interview With the Vampire&quot;, the vampire, Louis, tells about his life as a vampire. He tells us about his life in New Orleans with his maker, Lestat, who is a selfish and sometimes nasty vampire, and Claudia, their vampire child.Unlike Lestat, Louis loathes taking human lives, but he must do it to survive; Lestat often gets irritated because of this. Sometimes the two argued so much, it was hard to believe they were actually able to live with each other.The book takes us through many adventures, and some surprising twists and turns. I liked the dark feel of it; it was the kind of book I liked to read sitting by a window on a rainy day. I also liked how different the vampires were than most vampires in other novels I've read. It showed them as much more human than the typical vampire, and they weren't as evil as most would think.I would have to say that so far, &quot;Interview With the Vampire&quot; is my favorite Vampire Chronicle.\", \"This is the only reference that I can truly say is more important than a bilingual dictionary. 501 Spanish Verbs is organized alphabetically--just like a dictionary--and contains complete conjugations of nearly every verb you will ever need to use. Even after years of studying Spanish, I still occassionaly get stuck and can't remember certain details, like the difference between the command form of Usted and tu.501 Spanish Verbs lets you look up all of the forms of every verb. It is definitely the best verb reference out there! The one thing I should say, though, is that it does not teach you how to conjugate verbs, just as a dictionary does not teach you new vocabulary. It is a quick reference, and nothing more. If you want to learn the verb conjugations, you should use The Real Spanish Path. Don't mistake this for a critism of 501 Verbs--it is meant to be a reference, and it does a very efficient job of that.\", 'This book is primarily about relationships and how sexuality applies but specifically what Giddens terms a \"pure relationship\". This type of relationship exists between two individuals irregardless of gender. Characteristics of this relationship will parallel those of a democracy in that both individuals will have rights and duties but will be equal. Relationships will become a contract between two individuals emphasizing a confluent love rather than one that is dominated by economic and political controlling behaviors resulting in gender inequality associated with relationships within the realm of marriage. Pure relationships will be formed with set parameters according to each individual\\'s needs and desires. Additionally it will not be a relationship \"until death do us part\" but rather one that states \"until we no longer agree to be\". Sex will be one aspect of this relationship that can be negotiated as a rite but not as a duty and will be completely separate to that of the relationship. It will no longer be considered a right of the husband but a means for each individual to acquire pleasure.Hedonism will be widely accepted in the future according to Giddens. In fact he expects Hedonistic Consumerism to replace capitalistic productivity as the driving force behind economics and politics. The consumerism of sex is proof to this phenomenon. During the industrial age one had to work long and hard to be productive while sexual pleasures were considered detrimental to those efforts. The additional disposable time one has earned through an incredible increase in production via the informational age has reversed this view that sexual pleasure is counterproductive. A sexual transformation is at hand.Giddens discusses Freud in detail concerning the phallus and penis envy. He is somewhat critical of Freud but applies these concepts to explain how and why man and woman develop their sexual identity and how this identity explains society. Men develop a masculine identity while women femininity. It is this masculinity that has plagued man for it is a lacking identity. It lacks intimacy and so it desires what it lacks. Women have intimacy but lack independence and autonomy. At some point in modernity women have emerged from their role of mother to join society as an equal of man. This has led to a subconscious effort by man to control women. Man sees this emergence as a threat and as a result responds at times with violence. Rape is the modern context is an act of control or punishment. Rape in pre-modern times usually occurred in the fringes of society such as the frontiers lacking authority, during wars by soldiers, etc. but not as punishment or controlling measure but for the sheer act of sexual pleasure. Rape, according to Giddens, in today\\'s society is committed by loyalists of a day gone by where men ruled the roost. It is their way of being deviant.I think if Giddens is correct we will witness a future in which one will not be viewed as a \"manly man\" or a \"girly girl\" but as an individual without any gender specific roles to portray. This reminds me of Foucault\\'s view on Greek sexuality. The Greeks did not see beauty in the form of a woman or a man but rather saw beauty in a being irregardless of their gender. Bi-sexuality or homosexuality did not exist for they did not recognize the distinction. Giddens celebrates the lifestyles that are emerging in today\\'s world. These lifestyles are in fact not only emerging but are thriving so I would have a hard time disputing his conclusions that sexual emancipation is at hand. One only has to visit any urban city of significant population to witness first-hand the numerous gay bars and nightclubs, swinger\\'s clubs, and BDSM clubs that have opened in recent years. While I gained some insight into what is happening in society concerning sexuality, I am unsure if I should be confused or concerned.', 'This book is required for my second year nursing courses. As far as nursing textbooks go, this one is a pretty easy read. I like how it highlights key terms in each chapter. I also bought the older edition of the book and the current edition and I found them to be identical. I sold the newer edition and kept the older one and it is working out just fine for me.', \"One of the most chilling books I've ever read. Highly recommended!\", \"Damon Knight offers a simple and direct account of the early years in the lives of some of Science Fictions great writers. Most notable are Frederick Pohl and Issac Asimov. While joining the group late he manages to paint fair portrait of the early years through interveiws and a few remaining written records of the time, namley Asimov's journal and their communal house newsletters. The reader can draw his own conclusions about the group in-fighting and personality clashes. As a whole it is a fascinating story of the avant garde culture of the late '30s and early '40s. Its one weakness is that Knight jumps around chronologically, often jumping forward or backward several years during the recounting of a single incident. It is also difficult to determine who is recounting the story; sometimes there are first person accounts from Knight, a quote from someone during an interview years later, or a retelling of an event by an eye witness other than Knight. I would recommend this book only to the serious sci-fi fan.\", \"I have used most of the recipes in this wonderful cookbook of Pierre Franey's recipes. I have the 1979 hardcover edition with the intro by Craig Claiborne and it has been so well-used and loved that I decided to look for another copy for when my original falls apart! SIMPLE, EASY, yet still GOURMET dishes are the keywords for the recipes in this cookbook. I'm a mom to three kids under age 15 and even they enjoy these recipes. Franey has each main course on a double page spread, and includes suggestions and recipes for side dishes. There is a short intro paragraph for each main course with details and sometimes background as to how he developed the recipe and any tips for preparing/cooking the meal.I can't say enough good things about this cookbook, and it is one of the very few (less than a dozen) that I've kept after I downsized my cookbook collection.\", 'This is the second Raymond Chandler novel I have read after \"The Long Goodbye\". I rarely ever read fiction but I can not overemphasize how much I enjoy reading Chandler\\'s novels. These stories are most definitely NOT \"page turners\" and I mean that as a compliment. A \"page turner\" leaves the reader in suspense about what is going to happen or what is going to be revealed, often leading me, at least, to superficially scanning much of the prose in order to move ahead more quickly. There is some of this suspense in \"Farewell My Lovely\" (actually more than in \"Goodbye\" which spends more time philosophizing) but it is in taking every sentence as it comes, rolling it around in your mouth and savoring the flavor that gives the real pleasure in these novels.What particularly stands out in this story is the shades of gray of everything. Whereas many detective stories try to fit all the pieces together at the end and show us good guys and bad guys, Chandler\\'s protoganist PI Philip Marlowe sees the world in shades of gray. He doesn\\'t attempt to get to the bottom of people\\'s motivations, and that includes himself. At the beginning of the story, he sees a big white man enter a black nightclub and then sees a black man come flying out the door. For no apparent reason, and admitting that it was none of his business, Marlowe goes in to see what is happening and gets drawn into the mystery. We see people commit murders and yet Marlowe feels that they are not \"all bad\". Marlowe encounters some policemen who are good, some who are bad and some who are in the middle. In the end, Marlowe figures out more or less what happened, but admits there are holes in his theory, and he can\\'t completely explain why the characters he encountered acted the way they did. This is the way the real world operates and Chandler/Marlowe is telling us to be honest with ourselves and to admit that we often don\\'t know why we do the things we do and whether we are being really consistent.I find it interesting to note that although this story was written almost 70 years ago, it shows a world that is pretty indistinguishable to our own. The story does not seem \"dated\". We see the materialist Los Angeles society that I grew up in during the 1960\\'s and 1970\\'s, and the type of people who live on its fringes. The only jarring note I encountered showing the changes in technology since 1940 was when Marlowe mentions he saw an \"ice truck\" parked on the street. Well, I guess time does move on.In closing, this novel has one of the most famous Chandler-quotations of them all: \"I needed a drink, I needed a lot of life insurance, I needed a vacation, I needed a home in the country. What I had was a coat, a hat, and a gun.\"']\n",

I\\'ll pile on by also stating that I largely agree with her views -- strident though they certainly are -- on many subjects, including the nominal subjects of this book: radical Islam and its infiltration of Europe. And Ms. Fallaci was nothing if not passionate and entirely devoted to warning the slumbering guardians of Western Civilization of their possible demise -- not to mention their complicity in the same.With that neatly out of the way, I can say without reservation that I found `The Force of Reason\\' badly wanting. Reading page after passionate page of this tome reminded me of Emperor Joseph\\'s admonishment to the giddy Wolfgang Mozart in \"Amadeus\": \"You *are* passionate, Herr Mozart ... but you do not *persuade*.\" Simply put, this is a rant. An unambiguous, heartfelt, take-no-prisoners rant, but a wild screed nevertheless and certainly devoid of what I\\'d call reason. Most of it reads like the transcription of a one-sided conversation -- and the translation from Italian into English is painfully bad. (To be fair, we\\'re warned on this score: in a note \"to the English-speaking reader\", Ms. Fallaci takes full responsibility for the translation and admits it contains \"a punctuation and a lexical choice ... which reflects ... my way of writing in Italian.\" I don\\'t read Italian well, but in English this reads like speaking rather than writing -- largely to its detriment.)Regardless, as with any good rant Ms. Fallaci often scores good points. Her historical knowledge of Arab (and consequently Islamic) incursions into Europe is superb and she pulls no punches when describing atrocities that are actually celebrated by modern apologists. Even when punctuated by glibness like \"and do you know what happened next?\" and \"you think I exaggerate? I do not\" her research is solid.Unfortunately, she doesn\\'t support her other broadsides nearly enough. As mentioned, Fallaci\\'s passion is obvious but there are few real arguments here -- much less clearly stated premises. If she wishes to prove \"radical Islamists are systematically and conscientiously invading Europe for the purpose of overthrowing Western Civilization\" (which I surmise is her approximate position), she needed to *say* that and clearly articulate her *reasons*. This lack of coherence is especially frustrating since by the end of this blast I\\'m certain Ms. Fallaci *has* reasons -- and possibly excellent ones at that. But she doesn\\'t highlight them in any fashion and the conversational tone gives the points she does cover an anecdotal feel that doesn\\'t build on any previous evidence. Lack of organization hurts her case as well: chapters are simply numbered and she compounds this confusion by referring back \"to a previous (unnamed) chapter\" which is basically impossible to reference.I never heard the late Ms. Fallaci speak but I understand she was quite good. (The last thirty-odd pages, a transcription of one of her last speeches, bear this out.) Based on this book\\'s plainly \"spoken\" evidence I don\\'t doubt her persuasive skills in this area. Nothing wrong with this per se, but as filling for an argument promising \"the force of reason\" I read it as a missed opportunity. The author was a brave, outspoken, under-appreciated journalist with plenty to say; with clearer arguments and better organization - and perhaps a bit less malice (though it\\'s hard to begrudge her that) -- she would have sharpened the very important points in this book made significantly duller by her style.', \"Let me add my agreement with an earlier review of this book. When I was a graduate student our professor called the book &quot;The poor man's Dirac&quot;--reference to the well-known treatise of P.A.M. Dirac. In fact, Rojansky covers, in a very clear fashion, Dirac's theory of the electron, a topic eschewed by many introductory books on quantum mechanics. One of my professors found fault with the fact that more than 70 intitial pages deal with mathematical preliminaries and classial mechanics. With respect to the latter, apparently he felt it was unnecessary for graduate students who, he assumed, had already spent at least one semester on a good course in classical mechanics. One failing is that Rojansky does not use Dirac notation, although he introduces the technique in the chapter on &quot;The Symbolic Method&quot;.\", \"Joomla is a free, open source content management system and this book, by Hagen Graf, will show you everything about how to install and use Joomla for your website. The only thing you need to get started is PHP, Apache and MySQL. Joomla's modular structure allows the user to customize and extend the basic setup to meet their needs.Graf begins by discussing Joomla's various features and gives a general overview of how the program can be applied in real world situations. He then begins to give step-by-step instructions for how to install Joomla. Because the purpose of Joomla is content management, Graf explains in detail the program's structure and how to enter and organize your content.After covering the default setup, Graf talks about extensions - components, modules and mambots which are three ways to extend and customize Joomla. There are many of these extensions available on the web that can be used with or have been written specifically for Joomla. Graf discusses a few of his favorites. First, he talks about the Simpleboard component and accompanying modules which will add a forum to the Joomla base program. He also covers the Events Calendar component and accompanying modules. Next, he discusses the gallery component called zOOm Media Gallery and the E-Commerce component called VirtueMart.You can customize more than just Joomla's functionality and Graf explains how to create your own webpage templates to customize the appearance of your site. You can even use Adobe Dreamweaver to create these custom templates. Finally, for those readers who have a special need that has not yet been addressed, Graf shows how to create your own extensions.Hagen Graf has been programming since the late 70's and now works in his wife's consulting company as well as many other projects.

Lewis is a well-known mid-twentieth century writer with popular works in a variety of genres; religious fiction, children\\'s fiction, science fiction as well as religion/philosophy.Mere Christianity remains, probably, the most significant twentieth century Christian apologetic text. Lewis employs what is known as the classic approach to apologetics - starting with a general argument for the existence of God then moving on to make the specific case Christianity. Contrary to an earlier reviewer - this is a general introduction aim at the lay reader. Although all readers can find it helpful, it is not aimed at \"intellectuals\". Readers seeking more significant philosophical argumentation on these types of issues may want to look at the likes of Plantinga, Craig, Moreland etc.One small criticism of the book is the last chapter - it has 1940\\'s speculative science fiction feel. Lewis\\' interest in science fiction; coupled with the progressive view of evolution popular among thinkers at the time makes it feel dated and a bit out of place for an introductory text.Overall, Mere Christianity is a classic (The audio version is also tremendous). I highly recommend it as a starting point for anyone interested in Christian apologetics. Readers that enjoy this may also like The Screwtape Letters and the Great Divorce also from Lewis.', \"As others have pointed out, Pak Six is a short book compared to most combat memoirs, and has an unusual layout, but it nonetheless is one of the most intense and powerful air combat memoirs I've read in a long time; the raw emotional impact the book conveys was stunning.Basel definitely has a way with words; even his descriptions of more mundane events are told in a way that captivates the reader.

It's about finding your voice, and then using it effectively. What makes Maya Angelou's book so poignant is her honest narrative as she journeys back to the little town of Stamps, Arkansas. The reader is almost immediately pulled in to the story because we can simply share in her episodic adventures: Growing up with &quot;Momma&quot;, who is really her grandmother, and a very strict and dedicated Christian woman who doesn't waver from the God's will nor his ten commandments; she deals with an inspiring school teacher who serves as a springboard for Maya's eventual success as a person and writer; Maya also deals with the inequality of the races, the blatant disrespect by the white people, and the mixed feelings she experiences due to her parents uninvolvement with her and her brother, Baily.Maya Angelou is honest and straight forward with her language. This book is clearly one of the best books I've ever read. You have no choice but to be moved. There is something for everyone is this masterpiece. We all want to feel connected, to become a part of the story, if you will, and this book does just that. Maya Angelou is truly gifted as a writer, and we're lucky that a woman named Mrs. Flowers tapped into Maya's talents and encouraged her to expose it.

Good read all in all.\", 'The Norton anthology of Modern Poetry has now been updated and re-edited by Jahan Ramazani, and to excellent effect. The anthology now is split into two volumes, Modern and Contemporary (which here means poets who came of age slightly before or after WWII). Not only has the anthology been expanded, but importantly a poetics section has been added (the last 100+ pages of each volume), which includes Eliot\\'s &quot;Tradition and the Individual Talent&quot; and Mina Loy\\'s &quot;Feminist Manifesto&quot;, parts of Pound\\'s &quot;Blast&quot;, and other important works. This is a smart move, and adds much to the anthology\\'s usefulness.The Modern section begins with &quot;precursors&quot;: Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, Thomas Hardy, G. M. Hopkins. It is nice to see these giants featured prominently; it adds much to the value of the set, and the collection of their works is broad and satisfying. The section then moves on to AE Housman, Yeats, etc. up to Theodore Roethke, Spender and Keith Douglas. The Contemporary volume (slightly thicker, though both are over 1000 pages) takes off from there and includes experimental poets and those of more diversified backgrounds, such as Michael Palmer, Li-Young Lee, and Agha Shahid Ali.Introductory sections to both volumes provide broad overviews of poetic movements (Objectivist, Imagist, etc). While written in a very clear style that will not scare off beginners, these are actually well-researched and thought-through overviews that will be useful to serious students of poetry as well.The packaging is, in my opinion, attractive and sleek: two well designed volumes housed in a cardboard case. The paper is a bit thin and smooth (I suppose it\\'s hard to fit 1000 pages into such relatively slim volumes), but has actually proved most durable. The typeface is compact but fully clear and legible - not at all squished together. In short, the design is very pleasing, such that I find these volumes a pleasure to read and consult whenever I need to.A year since purchasing this two-volume set, I still believe this is the best anthology of modern and contemporary English-language poetry currently on the market, and an excellent value despite its hefty price tag. I\\'m sure many will find disappointments here and questionable decisions - but that holds true for almost any anthology. More people will find something to celebrate here - a remarkable selection of two centuries of great poetry in the English language.A note for teachers: It occurs to me that this volume could be well-suitable for a serious college-level course on poetry (or a very advanced high school course). For those looking for a teaching volume that includes drama and fiction sections, consider Kennedy and Goia\\'s \"Literature: An Introduction to Fiction, Poetry and Drama.\"', 'In this sparwling 500 page book, Cruse lays out his polemics against the Civil Rights movement for ignoring the economic issues that plagued us then and now,acusses black artists for betraying their own cultural gifts to gain wider credibility and lays down the basic ethos of American captialist life..

I enjoy both the book and the adaptations to other media. Only finished two chapters but hope to find some stories I don't alrady Know. Great book!!\", 'This is one of the most famous novels by Verne, and justifiedly so. A strange thing is happening in the seas of the world: a gigantic sea monster is terrorizing and sometimes sinking ships. The US government assembles a team of experts and sails around the world to discover the monster and catch it. Among them are two French scientists, Prof. Arronax and his assistant Conseil, and a Canadian harpooner, Ned Land. One day they fall to the sea while chasing the thing, and then are astonished when the monster rescues them. Alas, it turns out it\\'s not a monster, but a machine that can travel under the surface of the waters. That is, a submarine, nonexistent at the time the book was written. So the three men become the prisoners of the enigmatic Captain Nemo and his crew. The \"Nautilus\" is a self-supporting device, lavishly decorated and the work of a genius, a strange one. The central question throughout the book remains: Why have Nemo and his people rejected all contact with their fellow human beings? What happened to him and to them to escape the world and become lonely travellers of the underseas? Mystery. During many months, our heroes travel around the globe, and in the way they discover Atlantida, hunt in submerged forests, rescue a pearl-gatherer, rest in a submerged volcano, and fight aborigines and giant squids. Prof. Arronax classifies and describes every creature they encounter, which slows down the reading between adventures.I took one star out of the book because it lacks a central feature of any great work of literary art: character development. To reach the highest literary glory, Verne lacks psychological depth, the exploration of human beings\\' motivations. I would have loved to know Nemo\\'s story, his reasons for doing what he does. But it doesn\\'t matter much. To read Verne is to come back home, to turn back the time and be a kid again, flying to that moment when one discovers the infinite possibilities of literature, chief among them the chance to live other lives and see the world anew. Verne and his characters have a unique charm, and in this book the fascination od the ocean is added.', \"First of all the Kindle version is ridiculously poorly edited.

She is an excellent writer.\", '\"Alice in Wonderland\" is a literary classic which has had a vast influence on many writers after Lewis Carroll\\'s time. One can easily see where satiric writers, like Jasper Fforde, get their notion of twisting literary and familiar characters to suit their own purposes. This Wordsworth Classics edition contains \"Alice in Wonderland\" and its sequel, \"Through the Looking Glass\", which is the lesser of the two stories.Most everyone (including those who have not read the book) are familiar with the plot line. Alice follows the White Rabbit down the rabbit hole and finds herself in the strange and exotic world of Wonderland where nothing seems to make sense. As she continues in her journey, she meets a wide variety of characters - some familiar (like Humpty Dumpty) and some specific to Carroll (the Mad Hatter and the March Hare). Because Alice\\'s adventure is truly a dream, what happens in Wonderland does not need to make sense or follow any logical pattern of time or plot. \"Through the Looking Glass\" finds Alice back in Wonderland, this time with the promise of becoming a queen if she can make it across the chess board. The concept of chess ties this story together, but there are few strong elements which make this sequel difficult to stand on its own. It would work better if some of its stories had been incorporated into the original.All in all, \"Alice in Wonderland\" and \"Through the Looking Glass\" are unique escapes into one writer\\'s dreamy imagination. In a way, the oddities wind up making sense, allowing readers to philosophize with Carroll along the way. And for any lover of the English language, some of Carroll\\'s creations (especially the Jabberwocky) are astounding and wonderful plays on words. Sir John Tenniel\\'s classic illustrations help further the story, truly capturing the weirdness of Wonderland and Alice\\'s adventures there.', 'The most glorious history book I have read in a long time. Hugely entertaining and informative. This is a singularly American story, it sheds light not just on distant and little known events in our history but on American attitudes that we still exhibit today. I am struck by the parallels to the situation in Iraq today, the conquest of New Mexico and resulting clashes with both Mexicans and Navaho is a mixture of self interest and good intentions coupled with a lack of understanding of the alien cultures involved.The events laid out in this book were of huge importance to the shape of the United States today yet are little known by most Americans. We would all do well to read this magnificent book.

He can help her he decides and beyond that, there is something she makes him feel that he hasn\\'t felt for a very long time. In this anthology, the clich&eacute; is stood on its head and spun around for interesting results.This anthology, the third f the Fedora series, features seventeen hard-hitting stories of men being hardnosed men, dealing with the evil that walks the mean streets. While it is impossible to cover each story in detail, the selections below reflect a small sampling of the range of stories.\"Ordained Sin\" by Carol Kilgore features Nolan Douglas who just ticked off his girlfriend-again. But, a case that falls into his lap just might help him ease back into her good graces as well as allowing him to clean up some human scum. Sometimes the innocents truly do suffer and nothing and no one can save them.\"One Hit Wonder\" By J. L. Abramo is an intriguing story of a misdialed phone call.

Got a library copy and took it back, then went back for it and it had &quot;disappeared.&quot; I remember it as good advice for designers and since the software versions have not changed all that much, it would still be relevant. A new edition, updated would be nice (IS THE PUBLISHER READING THIS?). Even with the typos, I rate it tops for info content.There really is no substitute for Moye's book out, but for those wondering about downloads of upgrades, userguides and technotes, visit the Macromedia site. For others, get Macromedia FreeHand (at this writing in version 9 &amp; 10 has just shipped), as it is a perfect companion with many potent creation options and file export compatibility. You can make stuff like technical fonts (chemical isotopes with super AND subscripts), store images (I stuck some FreeHand animation sequences of calligraphic figures in its slots and can type an animation sequence). Watch out for Mac OS 10, as it is not clear that Fontog will run on it. Fontog will run OK on Mac OS 9. I finally found a copy at the Alibris site, so maybe they can dig up another copy (it will be expensive). As far as I have been able to find out (summer 2001) the publisher is not interested in a reissue or in selling the copyright.However, the more tricky you are with Fontographer, the more you need this book because it goes well beyond the software manual!

In itself the book does a decent job keeping us excited and guessing about characters and their futures. A must read for all &quot;Ender&quot; fans.Now again for the quotation marks. I know from speaking with many fans of this series that the immediate fascination ended with Ender's Game itself. THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE TRAVESTY! Perhaps I hold my allegiances too close, but I felt somewhat betrayed by Bean. While Ender was a reluctant hero, Bean is in many ways very arrogant.While I appreciate their relationship and all of Bean's accomplishments, it saddens me that so many readers have neglected to read through the original ENDER series. While it is true they have little of the strategic battles that made Ender's Game one of my favorite books of all time, they employ such compassion and psychology in a world that Ender chose for himself. Instead of returning home to the celebratory crowds (and Peter) Ender shuttles off to the world of their defeated enemies to colonize and create a new world. In this world visions of the past lead him to do something far nobler than any could imagine. Redemption and education persist and soon through his travel through time, he sacrifices all those who age in order to commit to a better world.All in all, don't miss the &quot;Shadow&quot; series for all the Earthly exploits we all wanted to hear more about, but PLEASE take the time to experience the ages of Ender's wisdom in creating a new world outside the one he left, and his absolute determination to improve the lives of not only those who hold him dear, but those who ultimately he was sent to destroy.Do yourself a favor, read carefully SPEAKER FOR THE DEAD, XENOCIDE, and CHILDREN OF THE MIND!

But the true significance of the book is to expand the highly influential theory of British expansion that the authors originally articulated in \"The Imperialism of Free Trade,\" an article which first appeared in the Economic History Review in 1953.The main argument of the book holds that British expansion in Africa occurred when crises on the periphery led the British government to intervene in defense of Britain\\'s economic and strategic interests. Robinson and Gallagher argue that official thinking during the period of expansion after 1870 represents an essential continuity with the earlier mid-Victorian era, which was characterized by a belief in the benefits of free trade, and by a conviction that British informal influence would secure these economic benefits at the lowest possible cost for the British government. British leaders throughout the nineteenth century thus held the conviction that the government was responsible to intervene in imperial matters only when it was necessary to safeguard the empire of free trade.Expansion in Africa therefore presents a paradox: it remained the continent of least importance to British trade. For Robinson and Gallagher, the answer lies in the prominence accorded to India by British ministers, who rightfully recognized the subcontinent as the linchpin of the Empire. India attracted one-fifth of British trade and overseas investment. It provided for a self-financing Army. It held the key to power in the East.According to this interpretation, the imperial \"scramble for Africa\" after 1882 occurred not as a result of British ministers pursuing economic or commercial interests on the continent, but rather to defend Britain\\'s strategic routes to India from local revolts and from increasing European rivalry. The British occupation of Egypt in 1882 became the decisive event in the imperial revolution in Africa, because it disrupted the European balance of power and set off a scramble. In Egypt and the Nile Valley, the British responded to Mediterranean instability and local revolts by occupying the territories crucial to the protection of the Suez Canal. In southern Africa, the British responded to the growing political preeminence of the gold-rich Transvaal republic by first attempting to cut it off from foreign support, and eventually by pushing the Dutch republic to the brink of war over the issue of British imperial influence on the Cape sea route to India. According to Robinson and Gallagher, there exists little evidence for public demand for empire in Britain, and even less evidence for a direct economic link between British ministers and colonial economic interests. In each of these instances, British motivations for imperial expansion in Africa traced to strategic interests, centered on India and its trade, in response to crises on the \"periphery.\"The main weakness of this otherwise magnificent account lies in its reliance on \"the official mind\" - the statements recorded by British ministers in official documents. This methodological approach supports Robinson and Gallagher\\'s attempt to create a unified theory of British imperialism, but it assumes that the rationale articulated by British ministers in official documents necessarily corresponded with the true motives for expansion -- a shortcoming that later books, especially Cain and Hopkins\\'s BRITISH IMPERIALISM, have made more obvious.In its time (1961), the book was a valuable corrective to the commonly held view of empire, which assumed that British expansion was driven by the search for markets (an influence mainly of J.A. Hobson and Marxist theory). AFRICA AND THE VICTORIANS\\' emphasis on the \"periphery\" also anticipated the growing influence of \"area studies\" and post-colonial scholarship, both of which, in different ways, emphasize the \"agency\" and importance of the non-Western world in shaping imperial outcomes.Nearly fifty years later, this book is still considered one of the most important contributions to British imperial history ever written.', \"For Edgar Rice Burroughs, life was relatively simple. Men fell into one of three categories: muscular heroes, ordinary types, and evil, greasy villains. Women existed primarily to act as universal lighting rods that attracted either the first or third category. Regardless of the universe that ERB wrote of, these constants held with predictable regularity. With the publication of AT THE EARTH'S CORE, he began yet another series that put the hero at odds with nature, evil doers, and beautiful, virtuous women. David Innes, the handsome hero, drills down to the center of the earth in a manner that brings to mind Jules Verne's tale, both of which posit a habitable, temperate core that supports a variety of lush, prehistoric life. Despite knowing that the earth's core was held to be molten, ERB did not hesitate to bend science for the sake of a good tale. ATEC possesses both the plusses of ERB at his best and the negatives at his worst. Like Tarzan, Innes is a likable, manly sort who feels at home regardless of whether home is a jungle or a tea room. The logic of how ERB gets his hero placed in an exotic locale is irrelevant and often purely unscientific. For his Martian (Barsoom) series, he merely had his hero, John Carter, gaze at the Red Planet to effect his transport there. For his inner world series (Pellucidar), Innes used a drill machine, a device that at least tries to be scientific. Once there, Innes has the necessary adventures with beasts, villains, and beautiful women, in this case Dian the Beautiful. The workings of the plot about how he finds her, loses her, and then finds her again are almost not to the point. Where ERB excels in his ability to place the reader, who is usually a 15 year old boy, in a realm that allows imagination to run riot. Events flow so smoothly that the youthful reader will probably overlook the negatives of ERB's prose style. In the world of ERB's muscular heroes, both hero and villain speak in the artificial, courtly dialogue that rings true only to the ears of the young. Coincidence runs rife to the point of ridicule. Beautiful women are haughty at first, but lusty later, and then only to the clean-limbed hero. His plots are often mirror images of one another. You can substitute the center of the earth for Mars, Venus, Africa, or wherever, and hero, villain, and lovely lady are interchangeable. Yet, despite all this, AT THE EARTH'S CORE is the kind of read that ought to be part of any kid's early mental universe. Reading Burroughs as a thirty year old requires a strong ability to suspend one's disbelief, but once having done so, the ride is usually worth the effort.\", \"A look at some real world cases where the implementation of Object-Oriented database design worked well and was successful.

      "[\"Men's fear and fascination of monsters have been with us since the dawn of time, and while the imagination of our forefathers was the main source for describing these beasts under the sea, up the snowy mountains or deep in the jungle, our technological and scientific age helped us to unravel a lot of these mysteries,and sadly bringing a lot of nature's animals to the brink of extinction in the process.Yet, this fascination, and apprehension remain with us to this day.While Jaws was responsible for keeping a lot of people out of the water for a while, me included, the portrayal of the great white shark was too over sensualized to be scientifically accurate, something author Peter Benchely tried desperately to redress years later.The man eating Lions of Tsavo, were real yet a rarity in the history of man against 'beast, a historical incident that was all but forgotten, to be revived later with the film Ghost and Darkness.Yet there is another animal out there, and most specifically in the Sundarban region of India, bordering Bangladesh, who also feasts on people each year, and who very little is known about, a mystery as dense as the region it inhabits,(one of the last true wilderness in the world,) the majestic tiger.And to that end, Sy Montgomery has done a wondeful job in investigating this elusive animal, writing a unique book of its kind, that is part natural history, part detective story.The Sundarban tigers are unlike any tigers in India, or in the world. They regularily attack humans, even snatching people from boats in the middle of the river.They are both feared and revered by the locals as creatures of divine power/source(a phenomenon that in itself has allowed many wild animals to coexist in relative peace with humans)However, the plight of the tiger is one tragic story, (some subspecies extinct while others following suit in an alraming speed) and the impression I got from Montgomery's book is not one of fear, although there are some scary moments in the book,tracking the elusive tiger, but one of respect for this beautiful creature. An impression that convinced me these attacks were against people going inside the tiger's territory, invading its lair, as opposed to the well documented cases of man-eating leopards and wolfs that boldly invade human's territory.Saving the Tiger at all costs is another impression I got from this book, a need that becomes ever more pressing, realizing the relenteless onslaught from loss of territory or poaching the tiger faces every day.By all account buy this book, and I guarantee you too will be fascinated by the story of when that beautiful animal do what it is instinctively programmed to do to survive.\", 'A fascinating story that will stretch your mind.

A tale of two differing personalities, the story is enticing, yet grippingOscar Wilde does an excellent job of revealing the contrasting atmospheres throughout the book. He does a fine job depicting the lighter side of Dorian Gray with images of life and excitement for example when he is getting painted, the light is bright and it takes place near a garden filled with beautiful flowers. Wilde is also able to portray the dark and menacing side in Dorian Gray as he eventually commits murder. Dorian Gray comes off as such a complicated character which makes him so interesting. He wants to fulfill his desires but is unable to do so successfully. People can feel how each person has a part of Dorian Gray in him or her. We all have our flaws we want to fix, but we should not become obsessive over them or it leads to destruction as seen in the book.The story is fascinating in that it is able to capture reader's interest because the mysteries in the plot are so intriguing. Although the book has that characteristic gothic element of a man living without the fear of death or consequence, The picture of Dorian Gray is still an accomplishment because it is written beautifully through the character description.The Picture of Dorian Gray is worth the read, as readers are guaranteed to be captivated by the mysteries the character Dorian Gray holds.\", 'As a male, hetrosexual, I decided that I should read this classic.

This isan awsome book.', 'This novel was the first one written by this particular author and, as such, shows the talent that she possessed of telling rich tales full of in-depth descriptions of her characters. Reading this novel was not a totally enjoyable experience for me, probably due to the fact that the writing of a nineteenth century author seemed a little stilted to this twenty-first century reader.The wording was at times difficult to follow, but the use of words was masterful. In this present day and age of instant gratification, the flowery descriptions and the lingering way of dealing with the subject causes the reader to slow down to savor the experience.The first half or two-thirds of the book could have been made more concise to hold the attention of the reader. Too much time was taken in dealing with mundane things. There was little action in the first portion of the book. In fact, there were times that she could have taken a less circuitous route to tell her tale.Miss Austen did an excellent job of describing the mores of the upper and high class society. She employed the use of humor and satire in her writing. The overly dramatic portrayals of heartbrokenness and disappointments were amazingly humorous. The social niceties were well portrayed - the practice of leaving calling cards, the pairing of \"acceptable\" couples, the importance of not marrying beneath one\\'s status.This novel is a must on a reading list of important works and should give the reader a desire to follow by reading Ms. Austen\\'s later works to watch her development as she progressed in her writing career.-----------------------', \"I couldn't wait to read this book because I enjoyed Nuala's autobiographal effort so much.

But after Ben leaves the newspaper to take a glamourous job on a television programme, the story falls apart, following one hard-to-believe event with another, with the author taking up threads of the storyline that had only been briefly mentioned, and completely dropping others.The Internet love that was only briefly discussed in early chapters suddenly figures prominently, and out of the blue, Jemima is going to meet him in Los Angeles. Jemima has lost 100 pounds in 3 months. The author notes that the trainer at Jemima\\'s gym is worried about her sudden huge weight loss, but never says anything, and this is mysteriously never mentioned again. Despite Ben being on a hugely-popular television programme, Jemima never watches (although it had been noted earlier how much time she spent watching television), so isn\\'t aware of his success. The much-lauded surprise ending is anything but a surprise...All in all, it\\'s a disappointing book. Even ignoring all of the happy coincidences, the message that the book sends is anything but self-affirmating. Jemima only finds friends after she becomes a size six. Jemima\\'s Internet love only loves her because of her figure. Ben only notices her after she\\'s lost the weight. The ending of the book is hardly an ending, and the epilogue tacked on reads like a legal disclaimer.']\n",

      "['I picked up Sanderson\\'s \"Elantris\" after having read his latest book (Warbreaker). This is certainly not as good as that book, but it\\'s still darn good (especially for a first novel). As with \"Warbreaker,\" Sanderson has come up with something unique as the driving force behind a book\\'s universe. Ditto in that the book is entirely self-contained, is well-described, and has several unforeseen and clever plot twists.My biggest problem with the book is the pacing: the first half of the book drags. There are a lot of things being developed, but not too much actually happening. Then, at the midpoint, things pick up dramatically (and even more so at about the 3/4 point). Also, there are one or two places where the main characters seem to have brain failure and fail to grasp something when all the pieces have finally been laid out in front of them. Finally (and most trivially), for no reason I can come up with, I had a tough time keeping the characters\\' names straight. The names are sufficiently different from each other and, for the most part, even follow a cultural naming scheme. But, I was constantly trying to keep name attached to character.Regardless of those gripes, this is still a very good book and I rate it at 4 stars out of 5.', \"The greatest book I have ever read! Without a doubt Carlos Castaneda's best. This book made me SO sad it is unbelievable. Once you understand everything that is involved in becoming a man of knowledge you have to ask yourself 'am I willing to give up EVERYTHING?' After reading this book I have made loads of progress in my own spiritual quest, no, I haven't stopped the world, yet. But at least I know now which way I am heading. If your leaning is towards sorcery and the revelation of it's secrets, you simply MUST read this. I have read everything on the occult (I kid you not) and I have to say that this was the one book that 'did it for me.' God (or nagual ) bless C.C.\", 'I am in awe of the fictional writers of the Roman Empire: Graves, McCullough, Saylor, Harris and many others. Steeped in the history, they can envision the time and bring it alive. Each of the novels I have read by these authors has brought me more in touch with some element of the complex culture of the time.Here, through a speculative treatment on how Cicero became a \"new man\", Harris shows us how elections took place and how corruption, for which this society was known, infected them. Harris also deals with issues of class and the entrenched attitudes about status. Through Cicero\\'s rise we learn and these issues affected politics after Sula and the Civil War.We also get a plausible portrait of Cicero, how he thought and what motivated him.I highly recommend this for anyone who has interest in this historical period.', 'Okay....so I read this book and came away with a very disturbing conclusion. There are millions of women out there who think it is perfectly acceptable to make someone love you by playing dumb, practicing deceit and manipulation, humiliating yourself by speaking/acting like a child to your husband, and allowing yourself to be used as a human doormat. Even more disturbing, there seems to be millions of men out there who get turned on by a wife who behaves this way. This book is a disgusting shameful example of what is wrong with Mormon women. I bet it is handed out to every LDS girl and particularly the sects who practice polygamy. I am certain my LDS next door neighbor practices the manipulative behaviors outlined in this book and she is one of the most exasperating idiots I have ever met. Trying to discuss any kind of topic with her is like talking with a stuffed animal. She has a vocabulary of an 8 year old and a blank stare and blank look to her face....completely utterly out to lunch....pretty fascinating alright.....', 'The book arrived on time, in good condition, however, I was disappointed that it was a paperback version. I should have read the comments closer and I would have known it was not a hardback--in which case I would not have purchased it. I do not feel it will remain in good condition for long and I am worried that the binding may work loose with reading and also will not store well on my shelf. I do not understand why this book was not offered in a hardback edition, after all, I would think most people purchase them to add to their collections and plan to keep them for many years.', \"Faith Geary left behind her small town home ten years ago, not ever intending to return. That all changes when her sister Skye calls in tears, on the verges of bankruptcy and divorce. Even then, Faith doesn't intend to return, but then she gets one more call, from Patrick Flynn, her once upon a time love who delivers the killing blow that sends her back to Minnesota. Skye's pregnant. Faith can't stay away while she is so needed after that.**** Stepping back home is stepping into chaos. Flynn is still angry at her for leaving, Skye is irresponsible as ever, the bar whose mortgage she co-signed is teetering on the edge of going under with her life savings, and all her old feelings are coming back to life. Romantic tensions run high and laughs are plentiful in this heartwarming read. Toward the end of the book, there are two absalutely priceless scenes that will have you rolling on the floor, giggling. ****Reviewed by Amanda Killgore for Huntress Reviews.\", 'I really like the character Kevin because he never gave up and he was always up for new obsticles. I would recommend people who like misteries and who like sad books to read this book. This book taught me to look at people the same. the authors style is like it really happened to him. I liked this book because it was funny and sad. One thing that disturbed me was that they left you hanging at the end of each chapter.', 'Louis dates this book between 1875-1879, with the action taking place in the Mogollon (muggy own) Rim and the Tonto Basin of Arizona Territory. The Apache wars are still in progress as we visit Camp Verde and while there are exposed to Al Seiber. Camp Verde was originally named Fort Lincoln in 1861 when established to protect people from the Apache, the post was originally manned by volunteers, and then later by regular Army in 1866.Al Seiber, 1844-1907, is a name immediately recognizable to any reader of the Apache Wars period. Al was of German ancestry who scouted for the Army, later being chief of scouts over the Apache scouts. Earlier he had fought at Gettysburg, among other civil war battles, receiving at least two wounds. History still holds Al, or \"Sibi\" as he was known by Apaches, with great respect. And his times with both Tom Horn and the Apache Kid remains in the mind of any reader spending time with Dan Thrapp\\'s 1964 biography of Al Seiber.This western novel assumes a somewhat strange storyline in that Tell\\'s wife, Ange Kerry Sackett, comes to harm, and is actually murdered. Not just murdered but strangled to death. It seems very much out of Louis L\\'Amour character in that in all his other novels he continually reinforces the thought that a woman alone would never be harmed by a man, no matter how bad that man may have been. It is therefore somewhat hard to accept, at least for me, that this is the storyline Louis chose to begin one of the Sackett novels. But there it is, and one has to deal with it to try to understand this book.As stated in other reviews, I have all of the L\\'Amour books in hardcover and read them over from time-to-time. In all my reading of his books over the last 40 plus years, this is one of the more unique Sackett books. If you have not read that much L\\'Amour it may not strike you in that manner.One interesting aspect, however, of this western novel is that Louis continually mentions the manner which the Sacketts will come to the aid of any Sackett in trouble. Well, in this novel he shows exactly how that would happen, using the word-of-mouth grapevine the fact that Tell is surrounded by at least 40 gunmen in the Tonto Basin area quickly causes any Sackett hearing of it to ride to Tell\\'s assistance.And it is always pleasant to encounter Cap Roundtree in the Sackett books. And I will let Louis himself describe Cap Roundtree: \"A salty old customer, a mountain man, trapper, cowboy, all-round western man. Dry as alkali dust and twice as bitter. A tough old mountain man who had hunted gold and fought Indians and had the scars to prove it\". That pretty much not only describes Cap Roundtree but can safely be applied to all the Sacketts as well.This book will afford its readers a couple night\\'s reading pleasure. Let\\'r rip!Semper Fi.', \"You'll want to use this thick boring book as a nice pillow after reading it for 1 minute.\", 'This book is great for beginners in CORBA, however you have to be a little more than advanced in JAVA or C++ to understand the underlying material. It provides good examples and I figured out how to better manage my IDL files/functions.', \"After reading Hikaru Okuizumi's The Stones Cry Out, I wondered if I was supposed to understand it as slice-of-life fiction, a cautionary fable about the lasting horrors of war, or something else entirely. The fable-like feel of The Stones Cry Out results because Manase, the story's protagonist, never fully reenters the world after his experience near the end of World War II. His devotion to rock collecting keeps him emotionally tied to the cave in the Philippines where, as a soldier, he first learned about stones. Because this cave continually reappears in the book, The Stones Cry Out also reminded me of a painting, a tableau of rocks, caves, and death, where the characters are trapped in single setting, at a single point of time.\", 'Gina Kolata begins an excellent story about the 1918 pandemic. Well-researched accounts about life during the pandemic fill the first chapters of the book. Gripped by the story, I read on eagerly into all hours of the night waiting for the chapter on the investigation of the miners bodies sealed in the permafrost I had followed carefully on the news.As I finished that account, I became concerned; I was almost out of pages and the author had yet to draw the story together. But I pressed on and found that the story just suddenly stopped; as if she had run out of material or energy.Clearly there are no conclusions about the 1918 pandemic at this time, but I would have expected the author to do a better job summarizing the story; perhaps at least a summary of what little we do know. But Gina Kolata quickly wraps up her book and leaves the reader hanging. It really feels like she just got tired and gave up.It is an okay book and will remain in my permanent library. But it could have been so much better if she had written the second half.UPDATE: I recently re-read this book and have lowered my rating to two stars.

So many of the classic novels are disregarded now a days is such a shame.', \"On Eugenia Riley's webpage, she has tips for suggestions on writing a time travel romance. I believe she should have listened to her own suggestions when developing a Tryst in Time.Over all, the book was very good. The development of the characters was very good, and very believable. Even the descriptions Ms. Riley did of the houses in both eras were very good, I could almost feel myself there.The novel begins when Sarah Jennings loses her brother during the Vietnam War. After a nervous breakdown, she inherits Belle Fontaine, a civil-war plantation, from an elderly family member she has never met. While meditating in the old crumbling manor house, she hears and sees a man from the past, Damien Fontaine.She gets transported back in time to shortly after the death of Damien's brother, Vincy, who was also killed in a war -- The Civil War. Still reeling from the death of his beloved brother, Damien has sheltered himself away from the world, trying to deal with his grief.The story is very interesting (I read this book in one day). The progression of Sarah and Damien's relationship is very fast, but very HOT. The love scenes leave you squirming in your seat, and the dynamic relationship between the two characters is very touching and most times leave you wishing you could travel back in time to meet Damien yourself.The complaint I DO have about A Tryst in Time is the believability of the time travel itself. Traveling in time once is one thing. Maybe even traveling back once, getting thrown forward and maybe finding your way back is another. But in this book, Sarah travels back forth so often you must think there is some kind of spiritual revolving door. One of the aspects of time travel romances that most people love is that this is a freaky thing that doesn't happen every day, for some of Eugenia's characters, it is as normal as brushing your teeth. If you have read Eugenia Riley's Phantom in Time, the constant time traveling back in forth is just about the same in A Tryst in Time. That is the most distracting thing about this novel. Just when you're getting into the groove of Sarah and Damien, she jumps back to the future for a few days, then jumps back in the past. *grrr*If you can get past the annoying revolving time travel part in the book, you will greatly enjoy yourself reading this novel. If you love a classic love story about true love lasting forever, this book is definitely worth a read. ...\", 'Sailor Moon SuperS Vol 1 is the first manga that I ever received or read. It is very good and definitely encourages my thirst for Japanese Animation as a whole. I recommend that before you read this Manga you become fairly well acquainted with the Sailor Moon series as the TV show has only gotten through Sailor Moon R in the U.S. and this book assumes that you know the characters from the beginning. The only real problems with the book are in the translation to English as some key names were mixed up and some of the storyline is a bit garbled in a very difficult translation between two languages that do not work well together. Like I said, a good read overall as long as you are fairly well acquainted with the Sailor Moon series and characters.', 'This is a book that you cannot lie down.

It helped me make my site (http://mysite.verizon.net/vze48sdz/) and collecting hobby pay for itself. The first chapter ($24k in 24 hrs)is hype, but it makes a good point - work your customer base. Makes a great off the shelf strategy. It is surprising how many sites could benefit from applying the techniques (hobby, commercial and not for profit. There is no reason a not for profit can use affiliate schemes for extra revenue).If you have a hobby site, and want to make it pay, or own a bricks and mortar business and are developing a web site, this book will add value. Allen's book explains how to market on the net simply and effectively.If you have a web site, are good at marketing and you get nothing from the book you are doing well.

You need to apply yourself to make the techniques work, they depend on good content and you will have to have (or develop) reasonable IT skills (or access to someone who does) to exploit this book to the full.Allen's books on real estate involve a fair degree of risk. This book doesn't (it does involve hard work and effort).

They liked this one less than Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but they still looked forward to reading it every night. It's true that it got boring when the characters floated around in space for so long, but they liked the part when the grandparents ate the pills--it led to a lot of mathematical calculations about how old their parents would be depending on how many pills we ate (each one makes you 20 yrs younger). Recommended!\", \"The ten plays in this collection (A Wife for a Life, Thirst, The Web, Warnings, Fog, Recklessness, Abortion, The Movie Man, Servitude, and The Sniper) were all written in the very earliest part of O'Neill's career, from 1913 to 1915, and were (and still are) all overshadowed by the numerous masterpieces O'Neill wrote beginning in 1920 with Beyond the Horizon. In the years before he began writing, O'Neill spent a great deal of time at sea, attempted suicide, and then came down with tuberculosis and spent six months at a sanatarium, where he discovered the works of Strindberg and others and decided to become a playwright. This is all reflected heavily in these plays: one of them deals with a consumptive character, three are set at sea, and a number of them end in suicides. Also, two of them deal with marital infidelity among the wealthy, a topic that I don't think O'Neill ever returns to in his later works but which was a favorite subject of O'Neill's idol Strindberg (in particular, Recklessness relates the affair between a married woman and her servant, which should sound familiar to readers of &quot;Miss Julie.&quot;).All of the plays except the three-act work Servitude are only one act and under thirty pages long. Presumably, O'Neill felt a lot more comfortable at this point in his career sticking to short treatments of matters that were close to him, and this appears to have been a good idea. Pretty much all of the plays in this collection show definite signs of the powerful tragedy for which O'Neill is known, and, considering how short they are, many of them are quite moving and haunting. While O'Neill had not yet reached his full maturity at this stage, he definitely was well-enough prepared to write very good one-act plays. His later, longer and more demanding works are very justifiably more famous than these ones, but if you enjoy O'Neill's better-known plays, his earliest works provide a very good view of the development of his style and talents, and you will probably enjoy them as well.\", 'With a name like Tolkien, any writer would be hard pressed to live up to expectations. I cracked open this British-style courtroom mystery leaving lots of room for grace.Indeed, \"Final Witness\" drew me into its mystery aspects quickly. I was intrigued by the murder of Lady Anne and the subsequent accusations by her son that Sir Peter\\'s assistant/future lover was responsible. On the surface, things seemed straightforward, but the jacket cover and reviewers assured me that unexpected twists lie ahead. I plugged along, waiting for two things to happen: 1) for the characters to make me care about their individual fates, 2) for the plot to take me on divergent paths.Unfortunately, neither happened.Despite well-drawn characters, efficient prose, and a passable plot, I failed to be moved or surprised. I also had a hard time hurdling the issue of a man proposing to his lover on the day of his murdered wife\\'s funeral.I seem to be in the minority, but \"Final Witness\" left me feeling strangely apathetic.

The story is set in Wisconsin at the same time that the American Civil War is being fought in the East. It was a time when everyone had fireplaces instead of heaters, paper and pencils instead of computer typing programs and outhouses instead of indoor plumbing. News and letters from the East come every few months on a steamer boat.Caddie comes from a large family. She has 6 brothers and sisters. They have plenty to do to keep them busy on the farm. In summer and winter they all go to school. In the off months, the neighboring town uses the school.Caddie is an 11-year old girl who is a real tomboy. She always takes on her brother's challenges and tries to beat them at everything. She'd much rather work in the fields than stay inside and sew. The neighbors think of her as odd. Not only is Caddie a tomboy, she also befriends the local Native Americans. But Caddie doesn't care, she is a free spirit. I liked that she was true to her self. She's a good role model.What I found most interesting about this book is that it's based on real people. The author, Carol Ryrie Brink, based the whole story on her own grandmother, Caddie Woodhouse.

It causes one to focus on the Christ in Christianity and presses the point that the focus should not be on one's goodness or the social values of the world, after one reasonably looks and considers the case for Christianity they will realize that it is true and real and that Christ might be trusted and that the sphere of religion isn't where my focus should be but that of Christ.A must read!

For a plant manager who finds himself in Rogo's place, it is an excellent prescription for what to do now to save your plant. It does not give you theory, but rather a rough and ready process to work with where the chips meet the floor.It does not however solve the basic problem in manufacturing which is &quot;How to achieve competitive advantage.&quot; Since it is focused on plant level reactive management, it does not focus on strategic issues and as well overlooks the beneficial effects that reengineering to a flow process environment could bring.The Boy Scout hike game is a very flawed example that will lead readers astray from good principles. In it he attempts to show that because of statistical fluctuations a balanced line is counterproductive. However the example that he uses is in fact not a balanced line as any lean or flow manufacturing student could point out. The line is not make to demand but push, the processes are way out of control (71% variability in process time), there is no flexibility in the line to handle issues, and there is no management of WIP via Kanban or anything else. He also stacks the deck somewhat in the rolls of the dice to make his point. Students of lean principles know that balanced lines are possible w manufacturing using proper principles such a Kanban, demand pull, etc.If you have a limited amount of time to save your plant, here is a good prescription.

(The target reading level is ages 9-12).Adults who like this series may also enjoy the Lateral Thinking Puzzles books.', 'I have read this book my entire life, I had to purchase it again because I lost it, it is a great book...I do not believe so much in what is going to happen today for you depending on your zodiac sign, but this book confirms 100% my believes that according to your sign your personality is. great tool to understand people, boss, friends, significant others, children....love this book so much', \"This book is a great buy for the price. This particular version is unabridged (unlike most of the other options on amazon, beware!) and great for someone who just wants to read it and doesn't care about flashy hard bound covers. However be warned this book is not a user friendly version, it has no foot notes and contains a few errors here and there. The binding isn't top notch either and my book took some damage in the process of reading it. If you're just looking to read what Adam Smith this is a great value and absolutely what you want but if you want any more you should think about spending a little more on a nicer copy with footnotes.\", \"I bought this cd for my newphew, who wasn't sleeping through the night.

I also bought one for my daugther, it works wonder's for her too. Just a Amazing cd.\", \"This is a fascinating book on two iconic figures of American history. I thought I knew who Custer was until I read this book. Ambrose has a way, like most good writers, to bring history to life. As compared, Undaunted Courage is better, but that doesn't distract from this book. Crazy Horse and Custer describe a very ugly side of how the native Americans were treated by white society. This is a must read for those that enjoy reading about the west. Great development of characters.\", 'I was surprised that this was an old library book. The pages were very yellow and it smelled musty.', 'I found The Business Grammar Handbook to be a no-nonsense, straightforward, solid guide to business communications and presentations. Not only does it provide an insightful set of guidelines for grammar, but it also presents invaluable information for effective chart presentations. This, to my mind, is a sorely needed and frequently overlooked area of important business communication. There is no doubt that the authors know their subjects thoroughly. They also know how to &quot;instruct&quot; the reader clearly, logically, and with a light touch. The book is eminently readable...I heartily recommend it to all business communicators.', 'BRIDGE FOR DUMMIES is a good and generous book and I have no trouble saying it excels over most similar beginners\\' books.Why? It\\'s CONCISE. Kantar, a world-class authority and bridge player, takes the reader who doesn\\'t even know that Aces top Kings and introduces the fundamentals of play. IMHO I don\\'t think he goes too fast for the beginner, but the book is . . .EFFICIENT. Kantar teaches the elements of play before the elements of bidding. He does this by teaching play at notrump (so the tactical elements of a trump suit are not at issue) and generally assumes a 3NT (notrump) contact, which is worth game. And it works quite well; play at bridge is difficult but probably less difficult than bridge bidding. Later on, we can take the strategic and tactical material we use at notrump and apply them to contracts at one of the four suits (Kantar defines trumps as \"wild cards,\" perhaps not strictly according to Hoyle but helpful nonetheless.)COMPREHENSIVE. Kantar goes all the way through trump suits, booking slams (contracts to take all, or all but one, of the card tricks), and other recognizable situations. He has an amiable, at times amusing way of introducing tips and necessary bridge terminology. He\\'s also . . .MODERN. He assumes the use of 5-card majors and will allow an opening with eleven high-card points (HCP to initiates) in a hand at any position if the bid suit is good enough. Weak two-bids, too, of course.I\\'m not crazy about advocating the 11 HCP opener in all positions but this is a very small wrinkle in this engaging and useful book.Notes on production: It is certainly true that the text of BRIDGE FOR DUMMIES is only in black-and-white and does not show red for the red suits of diamonds and hearts, but then neither does the daily bridge column in the newspaper. The FOR DUMMIES series needs to keep costs down, after all. At the time of this writing (July 2008), Amazon has BRIDGE FOR DUMMIES at an attractive discount, so this is a great way to get more book for your buck.', 'Created to Be His Help Meet: Discover How God Can Make Your Marriage Glorious is a good book. Thumb up!!!', 'This book is a summit of biased and illogical interpretation. It builds a case based on hand-picked selection and emphasis, which reduces significantly the fairness of the arguments laid down. The book does meet neither minimal journalistic standards nor reporting ethics. Definitely a waste of time, money and paper.', \"Larry Dossey has the ability to break right through all the head-tripoping about our spiritual selves, and talk about the real thing. As a doctor, he's concise, not wishy-washy - a genuine link between New Age and scientific. The book gives us new conceptual models that enable us to think more clearly about our own deep identity - and also inspires us to open up directly to our spiritual core - wonderful book!\"]\n",

      "[\"I love this book.I recently heard Mr. Galloway on the CBC talking about his writing and reading from this book. I usually don't buy hardcover books, but I was in the bookstore browsing for my nephew's birthday and I thought I should check out Ascension. The cover is beautiful, but the inside is even better! I started reading the first chapter, part of which I had heard on the radio earlier. He hooked me. I bought the book for my nephew and thought I could read it before I send it back east. Well, I read it, but couldn't give it up. I bought another copy to send!What makes it so good? The characters--Salvo, oh how I love Salvo. He breaks my heart. The stories. What happens. One of the things I love about this, is that you can see everything so vividly, but he never uses really poet language. The story is told simply and beautifully.I was haunted by the people in this book. Ascension is a very special story, full of special people. I HIGHLY recommend you purchase this book. You will fall in love.\", 'I am a 13 year old, and Im pretty new to short stories, but after I found this great book at my bookstore, I knew I was hooked. The title story is hilarious, and has a great ending. Vande Velde has a great sense for making funny, spooky, kooky and intelligent short stories, yet doesnt bore you or overdose on gore. I loved this book, and Ill be sure to get other books from Vivian Vabde Velde!', 'Vertigo continues in another series with a \"what if\" involving the Christian pantheon. The preacher of the title is exactly that, although he has lost his faith of late, especially when he is possessed by a spirit from heaven and barely manages to escape before his church is burned to the ground with his congregation toasted inside. Preacher is a graphic novel series that starts off with questions and intrigue, leaving readers wanting more.The spirit that has inhabited the preacher is known as Genesis, a burning ball of fire with infant features who was conceived between one of the angels of the Seraphi and a demon from hell. It\\'s an event that was never supposed to happen, and the result is a creation that can challenge the very power of God. Upon the discovery of this devastating event, the Seraphi killed their member who coupled with a demon, while the Adephi are left to imprison and watch over the creation known as Genesis. But Genesis manages to escape, coming to Earth in search of a soul which it finds in one Reverend Custer, the preacher. Custer is soon joined by a former girlfriend and a new friend who turns out to have some most unusual eating habits.In the style and graphic vein of Lucifer, Hellblazer, and other such classic Vertigo titles, Preacher is a series I look forward to continue reading.Originally written on June 29th, 2007 Alex C.

Match local recommendations.\", 'I can understand why this book isn\\'t everyone\\'s cup of tea--it\\'s not your usual science fiction, instead working much more like modern literary fiction. But I think it\\'s fascinating because the book\\'s structure actually models its subject (which, loosely speaking, is the relationship between chaos and social structure). At points the book feels random and repetitive, but this seems a deliberate comment on the topic at hand. In some ways, Bellwether reminds me quite a bit of Susan Griffin\\'s \"Our Secret\" in terms of how it connects cultural studies and science and the study of an individual\\'s life. The book at first appears to answer questions about how fads work (and if this is all you think about the plot, I can see how the novel might seem overly simplistic), but I think it raises more questions than in answers--and this, too, is replicated in the plot of the book, as it culminates in the start of a new research project.', 'I grew up with Anne Rice\\'s works at a young age, because of my cousin. We would watch the movie adaptation of this incredible book, and I would find myself liking it more and more as I watched it.I remember renting this book from my local public library when I was in high school, and I read it day and night. I took it to school, and even skipped a day of school just to read the last bit of it.I purchased this book again, just this year, right before a convention called C2E2 came along. I wanted to purchase the book for a long time, but when I finally read on C2E2\\'s website that Anne Rice was going to be a guest at the convention... You could not imagine my joy. She seemed very happy to see all of her fans and even hosted a panel with another gentleman. I honestly could not stay for long, because I was too excited that I found myself running down stairs. This was of course to start standing in line to make the autograph session. To no surprise, I found myself at the end of quite a long line. I did not care. I could not wait to meet the author. When I finally did, I was completely starstruck. We had only exchanged a few words like \"Hi. How are you?\" \"Good, and you?\" and I found myself on my way to hang out with some of my friends again.As I\\'ve said, I basically grew up with this series of books... More importantly, I grew up with \\'Interview with the Vampire\\' and \\'The Vampire Lestat (Vampire Chronicles)\\'.I love Anne Rice\\'s writing style. Every time I read the books in this series, I cannot put them down without picking them back up, not even for a moment. I like that the writer does this. She really grabs the attention of her readers, especially ones that have been vampire fans for what seems to have been centuries.I\\'ve read every vampire novel worth reading, and this series IS the best of them all. Do read them. You will not be able to put them down for a moment!', 'I found this book through a series of \"you might also like\" searches on Amazon. Coupled with the glowing reviews, I felt like I\\'d found a keeper. And I did! I love it when a book totally captures me... and on so many levels. The \"voice\" of the main character was so fresh and real, and the way her story unfolded with the \"birdman\" was extremely poignant. Five stars!', \"I will temper this review by noting that this is a _phrasebook_ and not explicitly intended as a learning tool. The book could be useful as a way of looking up something you want to say (if you can find it) and pointing to the chinese writing, but that's about all.Cantonese pronunciation is very complicated, and this book isn't very helpful in explaining it. The section that tries to give a broad introduction to the language is terrible. For example, early on it gives a list of 8 &quot;useful verbs&quot; which is missing staples like &quot;to want&quot; and &quot;to have&quot;, and in fact only has about 3 that are even remotely useful. One of the listed verbs is &quot;to trick&quot; -- a word that every traveller struggling with a language wishes they could remember.The majority of this book is organized by topic. Within each topic, it goes into too much depth to be able to find anything quickly, but being a small book it is not comprehensive at all. The dictionary section in the back is tiny and not very useful either.My copy ended up in a trash can in Hong Kong a few days after I bought it.\", 'I first read this book in the summer of 1969. It has come back to mind many times in the intervening years. I\\'ve often wondered if it was as good as I thought, or just such a new perspective for my small town young self. Upon rereading, I realize it is a really meaningful book. It has stood the test of time very well. However, it is disappointing to see that many of the inequities of David Champlin\\'s life still exist 45 years later. This is a really good read for anyone interested in the Civil Rights issues, or in expanding their perspective beyond themselves. The Kindle edition has a lot of \"typos\", but is well worth reading. Thanks for making it available again,.', 'My mother was given a collection of the Babar tales from a friend, so the books were quite tattered when I received them in first grade. Even so, the pictures moved me even before I could read the stories by myself. I remember developing quite a passion for elephants from the story of Babar, and learning about the illegal poaching of these great creatures in elementary school. In addition, the story of Babar and his adventures taught me at an early age that anything is possible. I ordered this book for my children, and hope they love it as much as I did.', \"This being the second of her books that I've bought and read, I've found her hard opinions sometimes border to the extreme but otherwise right on target. Looking forward to future books.\", 'I always wanted to read this because of the fact that it\\'s a classic and nearly everyone and their mother knows about Upton Sinclair\\'s \"The Jungle\". I suppose it was not a good idea jumping from the satirical work of Vonnegut to the depressingly realistic work of Sinclair. Truly, one does not read this book for the story since Sinclair seems unable to make you feel, against your will, for the characters inside the book. I could not, for the life of me, feel much sympathy for the individual only for the masses of the early 1900s.What is moving is the bleak, terribly real view of Chicago. The book was named well for the details it has to offer. Not only does Sinclair investigate the slaughterhouses but how every high-end, gold-lined pocket has its meandering tendrils around every corporation in the city. From buying houses, to going into saloons to drink ones sorrows away, to jail, to work and to the pain that everything eventually dishes out. There is sympathy for the millions of workers that slaved day in and day out for a few pennies to maybe buy a some food for their starving children.I have to respect this book for what it did for the United States; open the eyes of ignorance to what was really happening in cities around the country and invoke change. But I certainly cannot read this for the connection with the characters.', \"I cannot believe how long it took me to start reading Bond. I was a massive fan of the older Bond movies when I was young (but not so much the newer ones, after Bond's character became diluted in political correctness). I also love gambling, so I was thrilled to find out how detailed this book got about the intricacies of the casino games. Baccarat has always confused the crap out of me, but now, thanks to Fleming's description, through Bond, I have a fairly good idea how to play it, and would love to try it sometime!In the beginning, Bond is a complete misogynist, and a bit of a racist. I'm no expert, but it's shocking how little he understands women and how their minds work! Then again, I guess that was probably true of most men, back in the '50s, when the book was written.The mission is to out-gamble a powerful and desperate adversary named Le Chiffre. Bond of course pulls it off, and I don't think there's any spoiler in me saying that. The mission, though, is simply a prelude to the love affair between Bond and the female spy whom he worked with. I thought that that story was far more detailed than it would've been in the movie (I haven't seen the movie), taking up 20% of the book. I found it thoroughly satisfying. We get to see Bond's sensitive and philosophical side grow, even start to feel a little sorry for him. I particularly enjoyed his philosophical meanderings on the nature of good and evil.For the most part, though, I found the plot to be somewhat predictable. I think that that's probably because the story is so old now, and elements of it have been borrowed so many times over the years, for so many different spy stories and thrillers. Perhaps if I'd read it in the '50s, it would've garnered a five star review from me!One thing I can say is that the ending was a complete surprise for me, and made it all worthwhile! Can't wait to read the next one!\", \"No matter how many books I read of Mary's I NEVER tire of her characters!And this book is no exception!Good work, Mary! You go, Girl!\", 'In his introduction to this book, editor/contributor Al Sarrantonio makes clear his high hopes that 999 will prove a worthy successor to such landmark horror anthologies as DARK FORCES and GREAT TALES OF TERROR AND THE SUPERNATURAL. The dust jacket even goes so far as to declare of 999: &#8220;Not only is this the largest anthology of original horror/suspense fiction of all time&#8230;but it is also the finest.&#8221; As it turns out, however, neither the editor&#8217;s high hopes nor the dust jacket&#8217;s hyperbole are justified. 999 is in fact a very average collection of horror tales, with stories that range from pretty awful at worst to quite good, though not exactly excellent, at best, and the bulk of material falling somewhere between those points.Frankly, there are few high points in this collection. Furthermore, the high points of 999 are not particularly striking as far as horror tales go, and are only distinguishable as the points of greatest contrast to the indifferent and unmemorable horror storytelling that comprises most of 999&#8217;s entries.Still some readers might enjoy Tim Power&#8217;s haunting & unusual ghost story &#8220;Itinerary,&#8221; my favorite story here, which manages to be witty, fantastic (in the truest sense of the word), and melancholy without straining for effect. Kim Newman&#8217;s lead-off story, set in a U.S.S.R. under siege from walking dead American tourists, is a great, well-written combination of creepy horror and understated black humor, and makes a strong start for the book. Thomas M. Disch&#8217;s &#8220;The Owl and the Pussycat&#8221; delivers a deep bite in the gentle tones of an innocent children&#8217;s story. Ramsey Campbell&#8217;s &#8220;The Entertainment&#8221; lacks the potency of much of his stunning short fiction and bears a little too much resemblance to Robert Aickman&#8217;s classic chiller &#8220;The Hospice,&#8221; but is nonetheless a thoroughly sinister piece of work suggesting the unnatural horrors that can hide behind seemingly harmless grins.But then there&#8217;s no avoiding the negatives. Bentley Little&#8217;s &#8220;The Theater&#8221; starts off as a dully written reprise of Ramsey Campbell&#8217;s infinitely more frightening &#8220;The Show Goes On,&#8221; and quickly segues into a goofy psychodrama driven by the zero-personality main character&#8217;s unhealthy obsession with vegetables. Stephen King cruises through with a by-the-numbers tale of a demonic painting that could make for a passable episode of NIGHT GALLERY&#8212;one could be forgiven for thinking the editor was satisfied enough just having King&#8217;s name to plaster on the cover, so minor is his contribution. Peter Schneider&#8217;s &#8220;Les Saucisses, Sans Doute&#8221; might be well-intended in its mockery of the pretensions and cheesy glamor rife in &#8220;extreme&#8221; splatter-shock horror, but this short piece is too slight, the kind of thing one might scribble up to pass a lazy lunch-hour. Quite disappointingly, T.E.D. Klein&#8217;s &#8220;Growing Things,&#8221; a surprise contribution from this all-too-unprolific writer, also turns out to be a little insubstantial.The best that can be said is that there are some fine, if unremarkable stories between the covers of 999. However, the &#8220;good&#8221; stories are not good enough nor in sufficient proportion to invite comparisons with truly exceptional horror anthologies, such as the two volumes mentioned at the beginning, or THE OXFORD BOOK OF ENGLISH GHOST STORIES, THE DARK DESCENT, and the SHADOWS series, to name but a few others.', 'I was bored witless after reading the first five pages of this book. I felt like pulling my hair out after forcing myself to read past page 80, and I found myself at a hopeless standstill somewhere around the 200th page.I won\\'t judge the writer based on the one book of hers that I managed to partially read. And on the same subject, I\\'m not in any position to make judgments towards any person\\'s method of writing. I\\'m not an English professor, and I\\'m not here to critique Jacqueline Carey\\'s writing style.The thing about this book that bogged me down the most was the tedious progression through the plot. I\\'ve read in other reviews that the real story doesn\\'t pick up until you pass the 300th page, but I honestly don\\'t think it\\'s worth reading that far.The first few pages of the book relayed a sob story about how Phedre no Dalauney (who\\'s name I absolutely can not stand)was born into a world of servitude, surrounded by beautiful people, while she herself is the epiphany of imperfections. From what I forcibly managed to read, Phedre\\'s soul purpose in life is to sleep with strangers for money.I actually stopped and reread the pages on numerous occasions just to make sure I didn\\'t miss anything \"interesting\" that may have happened in the story while I dozed off in my efforts to complete each chapter.', 'Jane Eyre is a novel that follows a woman from the Victorian times in which she struggles to find her true identity and what really brings her happiness. Starting off as an orphan adopted by her aunt who despises her, she works her way up to become a governess. Through her struggle of finding independence in a society where women are looked down upon, she meets Mr. Rochester and hopelessly falls in love with him. Torn between finding independent happiness and romantic happiness, Jane indulges in a self journey fighting between what her heart desires and what her mind wants. Rochester is a man with much power and in a way intimidates Jane with his status but little did Jane know he was hiding a dark secret from her.\"Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and a field for their efforts as much as their brothers do; they suffer from too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags. It is thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.\"Not only is this a dramatic romance novel, but it is also a very eye opening novel in which Jane discovers that women should not confine to the expectations society has provided for them, but instead has a whole world to them for them to explore and obtain.', \"One of the most interesting books I have read, from start to finish. I was intrigued by how the writer George Orwell portrayed each character's personality. Each character had their own unique characteristic. For example, Mr. Floury's character was unique in every aspect imaginable, by the way he tries to help Dr. Veraswami's get elected in the club. He was not always positive, but in some instances he was cruel. There was a demeanor about him that was portrayed very well from start to finish. Other character's worth mentioning is Ma Hla May (Flory's servant); her actions throughout the book were marvelous. Each time she appeared in the scene, her presence was felt strongly. Her actions thoughtout the book were driven by her vanity, which led to her arriving at the church and embarrassing Mr. Flory. Burmese days is one of the most memorable, epic, and historical book on colonization I have read. The book was not just about one-man entrance in a club, but also of the hatred people bestow on each other. Was it their vanity that had driven everyone in the town? Is the failure to socialize extended to the natives ? U Po Kyin, villain who tormented everyone, a man without any sympathy, a man who was known to be notorious throughout the town. Most of the turmoil, which occurred during the book can be traced back to U Po Kyin doings. The addition of U Po Kyin made the book mysterious and full of mayhem. There is nothing one can add to make the book any better. I can say that the book is perfect in all aspect imaginable.\", \"This is Dickens' 3rd last novel, and nothing indicates that he was running out of steam. While this lacks (in my opinion) the energy of &quot;Dombey and Son&quot; (1848), &quot;David Copperfield&quot; (1850), &quot;Bleak House&quot; (1853), or &quot;Hard Times&quot; (1854), it is still a phenomenal piece of literature. Pip is an interesting creation. First we see him as a small child who is victimized by his sister. His brother in law Jo (while not too bright) never approves of Pip's abuse. It is interesting that Dickens wrote this troubled marriage scene soon after his own divorce! It is also painfully tragic when Pip starts to make his way into the world and he has to realize that the kind hearted but simple Jo has to take a back seat to his success. Jaggers offers some welcome comical touches. It is interesting that Pip becomes victimized by a legitimate colleague Orlick and as it turns out, the old thief was his benefactor. (In my opinion the old thief was a literary reincarnation of Fagin.) To this day, I have never forgotten the chills when I discovered that the old thief in the early part of the novel was his benefactor. So we have domestic quarrles, true to life tragic events, strong images, comical touches, and surprise events!\", \"This book blew me out the water! It wasn't what I expected!

I wish that he would have called me to write the ending, because I certainly could have done better. I can't imagine what happened to Harris's creativity when it came to the ending, perhaps he let Clive Barker finish it, or maybe his grandson.This book in no way resembles his previous masterpieces. Save your time and choose another.\", 'Mdm. Guyon had an INTIMATE relation to her Lord and Savior. She knew Him, she really knew Him. And her commentary on the Song of Solomon is required reading for anyone involved in the ihop aka Harp + Bowl movement; Her insight is phenominal; a good read!', 'This is the original \"Tibetan Book of the Dead\". All other versions are a toned-down version of this work by different authors who want to accommodate people who do not want to put the work in. You need to put the work in. No one can spoon-feed this kind of wisdom to you.The Tibetan Book of the Dead is an extremely authoritative translation of the original texts of the \"Bardo Thodol\" by Lama Kazi Dawa-Samdup who schooled W.Y.Evans-Wentz in Tibetan Buddhism. The book is an extremely important piece of work for both the scholars of psychology and religion, and the lay person who has the time to spend working on it. The book is also the reality behind the \"Necronomicon\" which has been popularized by fiction writers, such a H.P.Lovecraft, but has been completely taken out of its true context.To begin with, this book is a beautiful book once you truly understand the message that it is trying to convey to the reader - or more correctly, when the reader correctly understands the message that is being conveyed. It has a primordial air to it and is certainly ancient in its wisdom and understanding. The book was translated in the early 1900s and was first published in 1927. Be warned - this book is exceptionally difficult to read because the standard of grammar used is of the highest acumen humanly possibly. Evans-Wentz was a Doctor of Literature, a Doctor of Science and a Master of Arts. If you don\\'t have a full size Oxford dictionary, then you will have trouble reading it. There is also a difficulty in the translation. There are many Tibetan words that do not exist in English so Evans-Wentz sometimes derives a more descriptive meaning behind the message that is trying to be communicated to the reader. Dr. C.G. Jung has written an introduction at the start of the book which is mostly concerned about explaining the Tibetan meaning of the words \"Soul\" and \"Mind\". It is for reasons like these that the book requires multiple readings to fully absorb the information that is being presented. So what exactly is The Tibetan Book of the Dead? It is a corpus with several teachings. Tibetan Buddhist monks believe that if you understand the meaning of death then you will understand the meaning the life. It expounds in detail on the illusions of the human mind and gives a context for working out many questions that are philosophical and spiritual in nature.The book is essentially split into three parts. The first part has introductions from various students of theology, psychology and Buddhism. Evans-Wentz then explains the nature of the book and gives a rough breakdown of what we will find in the \"Bardo Thodol\" and how it is used to help the dead find their way to Nirvana during the after-death ceremonies (like an Irish wake) but also how the book can be used as a guide for the living, which is its true intended purpose. The middle part of the book is the \"Bardo Thodol\" translated directly into English and third part covers the topic of Buddhism in general with references to the different schools of thought and Christianity.The middle part of the book, the actual \"Bardo Thodol\", is split into three parts. There is an introduction at the start which explains the entry into the \"Chikhai Bardo\", the first of the Bardo regions that one automatically enters at the point of death. Then there is the second phase of the \"Bardo Thodol\", the \"Chonyid Bardo\" before the final phase of the \"Bardo Thodol\" the \"Sidpa Bardo\". Essentially these three areas can be explained as - the moment of death and the dawning of the light or nirvana, the karmic illusions of worldly things and finally the rebirth process. However do not think that this means that everybody is reborn or that Tibetans/Buddhists take reincarnation literally. It is all part of a thinking puzzle. You have got to work out things for yourself. There are hidden meanings in there. You must compare the different concepts in this book to find out what it really means! Question the \"Bardo Thodol\". Question what it teaches! Question what it says about itself!The Bardo Thodol is a technical and thoroughly scientific examination of consciousness that is still highly regarded as one of the most logical and controlled methods of understanding the mind and its relation to the world of phenomena. At first glance the book may seem horrid, uncanny and evoke a fear by the mere mention of the word \"death\", but this is a book about the living, dedicated to life and expounds on some of the most important questions that man can ask himself. It is extremely satisfying and worthy of repetitive readings. There is a pile of footnotes to help guide you through each page.Enormously recommended! ! ! !(As a side note Evans-Wentz wrote several other books to follow up on this one. They should be read in the following order - (1)The Tibetan Book of the Dead, (2) Tibet\\'s Great Yogi Milarepa, (3)Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines and (4)The Tibetan Book of the Great Liberation.)', 'Thomas Harris is a masterful suspense genre writer. This is common knowledge. What often get overlooked are the wonderful literary aspects of his work. Silence Of The Lambs works as both a suspense novel and a fine piece of literature.Gender issues are a major theme in this wonderful novel. Buffalo Bill does not kill his victims for money or sexual pleasure or fame. He kills his victims, all of who are female, for the most superficial aspect of their beings, their skin. Buffalo Bill wants to become a woman and he believes wearing women\\'s skin will make him one. I do not need to tell anyone to ask a woman to find out if it is skin that makes a woman what she is. Women are being objectified by Buffalo Bill.Also supporting the theme of gender issues is the compelling character of Clarice Starling. Clarice is an up and coming, star student in the FBI Academy, who wants to become part of the FBI\\'s Behavioral Science Unit. This unit is extremely difficult to get into. Jack Crawford, FBI Section Chief, wants to give Starling a job, however it involves a lot of paper work. \"It was tempting to get into Behavioral Science in any capacity she could, but she knew what happens to a woman if she\\'s ever pegged as a secretary - it sticks until the end of time.\" Starling is trying to avoid falling into the common stereotype of women in the workplace.There are many instances of gender issues in this novel, and if you still do not believe me, read the novel and figure out which room the well is under that Buffalo Bill keeps his victims in. These are not coincidences. The literary aspects are there. There are no `throw-away lines\\' in this novel. To say so would insult Thomas Harris. Every sentence in this novel is there for a reason, whether it be to advance the suspense or to advance the literary themes.Thomas Harris writes an incredible novel that can be enjoyed on a purely suspense genre level or on a literary level. It is a gripping story and one that propelled one of recent American literature\\'s most famous characters, Dr. Hannibal Lecter into pop-culture icon status.', \"I bought this book during residency just before my few months of cerebral angiography. What an excellent book!!! Its a great introduction to reading angio's and learning the anatomy. Even if not pursuing endovascular this is a great book to have.\", \"In the years since 1898, the Spanish-American War has been a frequent book theme. The focus has been upon the politics, the strategy, the battles, the role of Theodore Roosevelt, and the emergence of America as a world power. A few tell also of the Rough Riders--the men of the west and southwest, recruited from the American Territories--Arizona, New Mexico, Indian Territory, Oklahoma--who became the First Regiment, U.S. Volunteers, and fought in the Cuban campaign.J. C. Stewart's book, &quot;Cowboys in Uniform&quot; is another Spanish-American war book. It is one of several published in 1998--the centennial year of what became known as &quot;a splendid little war.&quot; However, this book is different. Its theme is the personal possessions of the ordinary trooper: the khaki uniform, the haversack that contained the trooper's food and property, the Krag-Jorgenson rifle and its smokeless powder cartridge, and more.The book explains how these men, originally recruited for service in a cavalry regiment were ordered to Cuba without their horses, to fight dismounted. This order was a significant change. After all, these were men recruited for their horsemanship, as well as their experience with firearms, and ability to live and work outdoors--and out of saddlbags--in inhospitable territory. Basically, these were men who practiced the physical arts and skills of the West.Here are detailed descriptions of the clothing worn by the trooper, the haversack he carried, and the rifle he fired. Color photographs of the very few known uniform items that have survived time--and countless spring cleanings--enhance the descriptions. Intriguing also, is the story of how the uniform and other equipment was obtained through the diligence, political connections, and speedy action by Col. Leonard Wood, the actual commander of the Regiment. (Theodore Roosevelt started as a second in command--by his own recommendation.)Photographs by 1898 cameramen show how the uniform and equipment was actually worn and carried. They also show how some troopers modified the uniform, either for practical reasons, or simply to express a little individuality. To provide a clear dimension to how the uniforms and equipment were employed, the author has teamed with several men to model the unforms and show how the quipment ws handled. These are not professional models, but men of the West who are familiar with horses, firearms and the rigors of life outdoors. Indeed, the author, who is also a respected Grand Canyon wrangler, and professional saddle maker (and who looks like a young Col. Roosevelt) models a replica of the khaki uniform that the energetic future President had made-to-order.This is a soft-cover work containing much hard detail, with extensive footnotes in each chapter. There are many more loose ends to the Rough Rider story. The author admits &quot;Cowboys in Uniform&quot; is not his final work on the subject. It is, however, a good first book. Moreover, with several more ISBN numbers registerd to him, we can expect more writing from him on this subject.\"]\n",

Probably because it was published back in 1931 that make the material so dated. Passage of time and reassessment of Theodore Roosevelt make this book somewhat of an oddity. Despite of being published just 12 years after Roosevelt's death, it was interesting to read that this was basically a pretty negative outlook on a great American. The style of his writing, the way he jumped forward and backward simply confused the subject matter sometimes. It doesn't helped that the author never really get into the mind, personality and motives of his subject. Many of the issues surrounding Roosevelt's life are simply not in-depth enough to be interesting or informative.I supposed for readers back in the 1930s, this book had a lot to offered. But nowadays, with works by Edmund Morris, David McCullough, Nathan Miller and Kathleen Dalton, there is really very little purpose in reading this book. It doesn't offered any thing new nor offered any great insights.I read it because it was so highly acclaimed back then. It won the Pulitzer Prize and won high reviews back then.

Fathers and Sons relates not only the generation gap in 19th century Russia, but also shows how fragile and fake the entire Russian system was in that time period. Every character symbolizes an important facet of Russian society. Paul Petrovich is the old slavophile nobility, convinced that Russians and their ways are the best in the world while they wear English clothing and speak and read in French. His brother Nicholas is the bridge between the old world and the new world, trying to fit in with the new ways while he only understands the old customs. Arcady, who represents those in society who outwardly follow the latest trendy beliefs but can't shake their emotions or their humanity. And Barazov, who represents youth, with its eternal promise of new ideas and ways, but who are blind to their own naive hypocrisy. Certainly there are other characters, but these major figures shape the plot of the book.Turgenev manages to leave no stone unturned, casting withering attacks on peasants, psuedo-intellectualism, government officials, corruption, and conventions. The book mentions that Turgenev alienated and angered many in Russia with this book, and the reader will quickly see why.Turgenev recognized the backwardness of Russia, and that it must change if it were to survive in a new world. The big question was how, and Turgenev shows that while idealists like Bazarov may have new ideas (Bazarov's idea was nihilism, a belief in nothing), those ideas mean nothing if not backed up with solutions to the problems.An excellent book, and very readable. The price is low enough that most people really don't have an excuse to give this one a shot.\", 'Smooth transition into my Kindle...Good ValueI Would purchase from this seller again.A pleasure to do business with!', \"This book, in my opinion, is Agatha Christie's second best, after &quot;The ABC murders&quot;.

      "[\"As a first generation Asian immigrant, I thought this book would be a bit of a reflection on my experience. I definitely empathize a lot with the characters in the story, but I didn't sympathize with them (maybe except for Blondie and Wendy, a little bit). Most of the characters are not likeable and are too much like caricatures. The depiction of Asian-American culture is very accurate, although a bit exaggerated at times. It certainly highlights the negatives and the stereotypes of Asian people (such as the submissiveness of the women, the cunning and greed) and I don't think this story would improve race relations.The plot is also quite weak. The book is really just about the everyday lives of the protagonist family. The story is told from multiple points of view simultaneously. As I was reading it, I felt like I was peeking into a group therapy session and it was not a pleasant one. There were little joys (with baby Bailey) and some twists in the story, but I wasn't able to be invested in any of the characters. By the middle of the book, I found it difficult to continue reading; the story didn't capture my imagination and I almost lost interest in finishing the book.I really really wanted to like this book, but in the end, I didn't enjoy reading it. I'm all for dramatic plot lines and stories that are not all rosy or Pollyanna-ish, but the tone of this book is quite a downer throughout and I didn't like it. However, if you're curious about Asian-American culture and a mixed culture/adopted family, this might be an interesting book for you.\", \"As you can see from the table of contents the author traces English eucharistic thought from the Reformation through to the Puritans and on to the Evangelical revivals of the 1700s and then on to the most significant Evangelical divines of the 1800s such as Bishop Ryle. The author also then discusses the Evangelical response to Tractarianism, modern ecumenism and the influence of the Charismatic movement on the Church of England. It is helpful to note that none other than John Wesley celebrated Holy communion five times a week and that George Whitefield too longed to partake of it, sometimes twice on one day. Scholars have concluded that the Wesleyan revivals were also a revival of a high view of the Eucharist inside the Church of England as some 250 hymns were written about the blessings and benefits one receives from the Lord's Supper by none other than Charles Wesley during the first wave of Evangelical revivals that swept through Britain and the Colonies in the mid 1700s. When Evangelicals weren't reacting to High Churchmanship or fending off Anglo-Catholicism we see that they too held a high view of the Eucharist as a means of grace despite the potential problems that might arise when one holds an even higher view of justification by faith.\", 'Another great book from the pen of Chuck Palaniuk.

Based in the 1930's, To Kill a Mockingbird delivers a realistic, heart warming story. This is a truly intriuging book, that the reader wil not want to put down.

Though the plot of the story was quite good, there was not that much character development of the heroine. None of the characters captured my heart, and my attention just kept wandering. And while the hero\\'s daughter was cute, she was a six-year-old who talked like a twenty-year-old. I know some authors do this as a cute character quirk, but this author treated the little girl\\'s way of speaking as if it was perfectly normal. I just couldn\\'t get into this story and ended up skipping to the second one about halfway through. Three stars.The second story (Sweet Sea Spirit) captured my heart and would not let it go. I had never read anything by Emilie Richards before, but her name is now on my list of authors to watch for. \"Sweet Sea Spirit\" a story I now read every year. This story was written entirely from the heroine (Sandy\\'s) point of view, which was an interesting change from the head-hopping you often find in romance. Sandy is just wonderful, a sweet, plucky woman who marries a serious man and then tries to change herself into what she thinks he wants, not realizing that he fell in love with who she really is. This novella also had some touching \"big family\" moments, which I really enjoyed, but the main focus was on the romance - exactly where it should be. A wonderful story about being true to yourself, I get tears in my eyes every time I read it. Five stars.Though the first story is not worth the money, the second one more than makes up for it.

This book of stories involves ordinary people then, living ordinary lives of decency or indecency, of humor, of humility and of quiet desperation, who just happen to be of Indian descent. Ms. Lahiri uses details of foods, of cooking, of color and of nature in beautiful ways and often as metaphors to exclaim and reveal to the readers, the certain &quot;truths&quot; or &quot;conditions&quot; of her characters. The stories in themselves are interesting enough, if not exactly Earth shattering as all the critics are raving. After all, this book did win the Pulitzer Prize. Fine then, why did I agonize first over buying this book, after reading one story, &quot;A Temporary Matter,&quot; over the Internet? I also agonize over what I think about the book.As an aspiring writer, who came back to her calling after 10 years of trying to ignore the promptings with in me--as Herman Hesse said in &quot;Demian,&quot; why was it so difficult to live in accordance with the promptings from within?--When I first found out that Ms. Lahiri, who is the same age as I am, had won the Pulitzer, my first reaction was incredulity then pure GREEN ENVY! I too was an English major, thought about getting my PhD in literature, but thought better (or worse) and got a terminal graduate degree (ha ha) and entered the professional world (ha ha). Well, yadda, yadda, yadda, I did not want to pay the price of struggling through student debts and living my 20s in the library. Oh well, these are the rewards sometimes--the Pulitzer--well good for her. Fine then.But, I agonized over giving this book 3 stars and not 4, and I agonized over why I was sorely disappointed when I read a book by someone who was my age, also Asian and a fellow writer who had made good. In all fairness, I will preface by saying that I had the same &quot;reaction&quot; but more strongly to Amy Tan's book &quot;Joy Luck Club,&quot; which I enjoyed watching as a movie but DID not like from page one. This is why. As an Asian American, and as a woman, like Ms. Lahiri (and like Ms. Tan), I am ecstatic that we have a literary voice. However, I can not stomach the &quot;exotification&quot; of the Asian experience! It's as simple as that. Another reviewer on Amazon said that she found this book to be a bit too exotic for the average American reader, she thought. Well, let me tell you, who wouldn't find this book ringing a bit exotic. If you lived in India or if you were Indian American, would you consider yourself exotic?? Of course not! So why should this book or any book on anyone who is not of European decent be exotic?? Ms. Lahiri could have made the same observations, same insights and commentaries about the lives of her characters without employing the traditional American practice of &quot;exotification&quot; of experiences that are considered outside of the &quot;NORM,&quot; whatever that is.I have to say in fairness again, that some Southern American writers also exploit, oops, explore the &quot;exotification&quot; of their people. Look at John Berendt with the based on truth &quot;Midnight In the Garden of Good and Evil.&quot; There are many other writers, particularly Southern, as it were, who write short and longer stories about &quot;weird&quot; and &quot;exotic&quot; people and settings. Of course, as someone once said, who wants to read about boring people? True, but does the stories, as in &quot;Interpreter of Maladies,&quot; have to be so formulaic? Do we have to ah and goo goo ga ga over painfully ordinary activities as cooking, written however adroitly, to capture dramatic tension? Do we always have to marvel at the beauty regimens of slathering on coconut oil in our black hairs? Do we always have to marvel how different we are because we don't drive on the right side of the road like Americans? (Ms. Lahiri mentions that in India people drive on the left side of the road, she mentions this no less than in three of the nine stories, most likely to puctuate how different things are from there to here). Do we have to pander to critics and crank out contrived eloquence and cloying exoticism? Lest anyone thinks that this is a personal review, let me tell you, it is. I have high expectations of writers and of critics!\", \"Part Two of Flowers in the Attic.Carrie, Chris and Cathy have escaped the attic at last. Now we get to see how messed up their lives will be.Incase you missed Flowers in the Attic, it's about a greedy woman who decides to hide her kids in a attic from her father. He won't let her inherit if she had any kids from her uncle she was married too. This kids spent four years in the attic waiting for escape as they hit puberty together and commited incest.Now in Petals, we find Chris and Cathy trying to get on with their lives. We watch Cathy try to pull away from Chris, but he knows his sister is his soulmate.Petals is ok at best through most of it as it skips around a lot over several years of their lives. What kills me is Cathy. Just when you think she's going to be ok, she makes the dumbest decision in the world. Things seem ok, then Cathy gets lied too. The author skips a couple chapters of progression, and out of nowhere, Cathy is making the most idiotic decision ever. I won't spoil it, but this disgust me and makes Petals my least favorite under the name. If good writing is making a character so moronic that you can never forget her, then V.C Andrews is the best!But she's not the best. Remember the progression missing? Missing chapters? It's almost like she just decided to do what we won't expect just to tick us off. She tries to correct it later by saying Cathy is impulsive, but she's not. Not enough for this decision. No, this is the worst writing mistake of all time.These first two books are creative and one of a kind, but overall nothing special. They are average, but grabbed our attention as we hoped they would escape the attic and avoid incest. These two books get credit for the fame of the V.C Andrews name and get a ghost writer hired to write in her honor. It's important to remember how she got famous. She writes about tragedy. Usually a family member will do something unspeakable that rips everyone apart. Secrets, incest or forbidden romance, and main characters who are ok, then make a decision that will wreck their lives.The reason to remember this is because that is what the ghost writer is getting paid to imitate.In every book I can think of, he copies at least one of the area's that made her famous. And usually does it better. He gives us a hint of forbidden romance, but thankfully we don't actually see it. He makes us a good main character then has her make one decision that messes everything up. Usually his character decisions are a lot more realistic than Cathy's. He writes four series after this one that are all better. After reading them, I believe he's the reason the VC Andrews name is so popular. He writes some darn good books, then ruins them by the bad character decisions usually. He needs to write like her, to be under her name, but he doesn't have to ruin them. Like she did. If he'd only write for himself, some would be best sellers.Most V.C Andrews books cover tragedy and romance. Their not really a romance, but most have strong secondary romance plots. All most all of them grab us within the first chapter and keep us glued. The ghost writer gives us some amazing stories, but usually leaves us feeling sick as tragedy strikes. Just like this one, except better written.\", \"I found this book by chance at a second hand book sale while on summer holiday about three years ago. The edition was printed in 1975 and by now (after reading over and over) looks rather shabby.I had never heard of the author before and was merely looking for something to pass the time. It didn't pass much time, because once I started reading I couldn't put it down, and only took me one day to finish.Joel Townsley Rogers puts you, ne&eacute;, throws you right in the middle of a first-person account of this murder mystery that unfolds in one day. The story and subsequent mystery slowly unravels as he takes you back in time, revealing the characters and the events leading up to the day in which the story is told.You start guessing and wondering, painting your own mental images of the characters and surroundings desribed with meticulous attention detail.There are clues throughout the book, and careful reading is required. Read it again and again, and more clues are revealed.As far as endings to any book are concerned, they're pretty imprtant, so I won't divulge any details.

As a fiction writer for entertainment purposes, two thumbs up. The unfortunate part about this book is that it is represented as non-fiction, but unlike good documentaries, it very obviously includes only one side of the debate. If anyone takes this book seriously, and is genuinely scared about the health risk of North American food, please look into the true facts behind this or any other similar fear mongering story. The actual facts were evaluated in a court of law, and the accusations were proven false.

      "[\"Although the concepts were well described and extremely well argued, I feel the discussion was not direct enough to reach the intended audience. Although I gained some insight in a number of areas, I didn't find the agruments compelling enough to reach someone who isn't already familiar with the ethics. As a book which is supposedly aimed towards people who aren't already familiar with applying some of the concepts in their life, I found the treatise too difficult to follow. There were not enough practical suggestions, implementations or meditation suggestions to help someone really find what to do.As a philosophical treatise explaining the logic of ethical and compassionate behavior, I found it was too drawn out and read like intellectual acrobatics. I am an admirer of HHDL, and I have read some of his other books, but found this one did not really hit the mark.\", \"I ordered this book used.

You get to see the motivation and the story behind the story; I hope this book comes out on Kindle one day. It deserves to be read and the out-of-print prices are high enough to turn away readers.', \"Although Kaplan attempts to style this dense book as a semi-linear travel narrative, it is actually more of an heavily footnoted eyewitness account of the dramatic transitions occurring in various developing regions. Chock full of provocative and disturbing ideas culled from many social sciences, the book starts with a largely pessimistic 89 pages of West Africa and 37 pages of Egypt. I didn't find anything particularly new or illuminating in these two sections, but they serve as a good introduction to the issues if you aren't familiar with what's happening there, although recent events somewhat date his account of West Africa in particular. It didn't take me long to get fed up with Kaplan's machine gun use of statistics to support his observations. That, and his tendency to repeat himself, undermine his attempts at literary narrative. Fortunately, I came to a deeply engrossing 45 pages of Turkey and the Caucuses, 70 pages of Iran, and 96 pages of Central Asia. These three sections were what made the book for me, even readers already familiar with the areas will find value in Kaplan's account. It was here that Kaplan seemed most comfortable and most knowledgeable. Lots of great info about the ethnic dynamics of the areas and great historical tidbits make these worth interesting even if you don't read the sections before or after. What follows is a sporadically interesting 100 pages on the Indian subcontinent and &quot;Indochina.&quot; The book is greatly aided by its maps, and Kaplan is careful to acknowledge the sources of the ideas he presents. There is also an excellent bibliography for those interested in followup reading. The great value in this book lies in Kaplan's insistence (correct in my belief) that population growth is the single most destabilizing force in the world today and that it must be addressed before all else.\", \"The hobbit bilbo, the wizard gandalf and a bunch of dwarves went on an adventure to recover the dwarves' treasure.

Too much of the novel was dedicated to scenes that had nothing to do with the interaction between the main characters, as if this book was trying to NOT concentrate on the romance. Yet, this is a romance novel, so it didn't make the least amount of sense. Either write a romance or don't.\", 'So, I just picked up and finished Bitter Harvest this week. I felt the book was extremely slanted and left little to be desired in terms of suspense or plot twist. What\\'s more - there HAS to be a way for Ann Rule to drive her point home without repeating key plot elements verbatim over and over again. Often times, I would put the book down, only to find when I picked it up again, I felt I had accidentally lost my place and gone backwards. Seriously, paragraphs and paragraphs of unnecessary repitition litter this otherwise gripping story of a mother driven to horrific revenge to \"punish\" her husband for his actions. Yes, this is true crime and consistent details among third parties are key - but hearing the same phrases about the father, Mike, again and again certainly supported the fact that Deborah had turned the kids against him - but really, they were mentioned no less than four times throughout (often by the same people, in different conversations) - just to make sure we \"got it.\" Paraphrasing the trial portion also would have been nice. I could have (and did) skip ahead just to get to the climax - after all the story is written in such an anti-Deborah fashion that my mind was made up after the first chapter. After that, there\\'s Mike\\'s letter and an Epilogue which adds no insight or clues that weren\\'t already brought to bear earlier in the book.Overall the story drags at times and could\\'ve been more concisely written.

      "[\"As a long-time admirer of Al Parker, I was delighted to stumble across this account of his life. The author's access to intimate details of Parker's youth made for compelling reading, especially the macabre accounts of Al's losing his virginity to a knife-wielding psychopath! Al's experiences at Woodstock were a hoot. I also found the story of his entry into the porn world with the encouragement of his lover to be very interesting. I had always imagined Rip Colt to be as hot as the men he photographed. What an eye-opener that was!The background info on the films themselves was very welcome to an aficionado like myself. I've seen them all a hundred times and the insider gossip and behind-the-scenes details make for interesting reading.Most of all, I was delighted to discover just how ordinary this sexual icon of gay liberation really was. To know that he was involved in a serious relationship that spanned fifteen years, all the while fueling fantasy fires across the gay spectrum was quite a turn-on for me. It was also gratifying to read about his pioneering efforts in bringing safer sex to the gay, X-rated video screen.While checking out this site, I couldn't help but notice that a couple of people had just the opposite opinion of this book. All I can think is that they didn't read it carefully, or that they expected Al Parker to be what he seemed to be on film. From all I gathered from the book, Drew Okun was a great guy. I wish I could have known him.Read the book and you'll have a better sense of the gay porn industry from its early years through the AIDS crisis.

It is a testament to many of the uncelebrated lives that survived WW2 and what they went on to create.

After several shipwrecks, the Abraham Lincoln is dispatched to kill what the world believes to be some kind of animal. After a battle with the \"creature\", the three main characters, Professor Aronnax, his servant/research assistant Conseil, and Canadian \"King of the Harpooners\" Ned Land are swept overboard. When they awake, they find that they are prisoners aboard the Nautilus, a submersible vessel under the command of the mysterious Captain Nemo and his equally enigmatic crew.Captain Nemo refuses to allow the three men to leave his ship, but otherwise treats them well. They are allowed the run of the ship and Professor Aronnax soon becomes quite taken with the research opportunities afforded to him by the submarine. His assistant Conseil is happy to do whatever his master wishes, but Ned Land becomes increasingly agitated and determined to escape as the story progresses. Dominating the tale is the figure of Captain Nemo, a man who has forsworn his allegiances to country and humanity to command his own destiny under the world\\'s seas and oceans.The Nautilus takes the men on many strange and exciting adventures. Verne peppers the story with scientific detail. It\\'s mostly fascinating, although the multiple listings of fish, fauna, and flora can become cumbersome at times. The novel is at its best when Aronnax is wrestling with the mystery of Captain Nemo and his motives, as well as his own conflicting desires to remain on the Nautilus and explore the reaches of the deep or to join Ned Land\\'s quest for freedom.Stirring in places, the story of Captain Nemo and his amazing undersea vessel shouldn\\'t be missed by any fan of science fiction/fantasy.

While an undergraduate, I met many poets established and aspiring who encouraged me to continue my writing, regardless of whether or not it was ever published. I had one book published in 1986, and am pleased to have another collection available today.Much of my poetry in this book is derivative of more established styles. In my latest writing, I have begun to try to develop an independent style, but this collection consists of poetry from the 1980s and early 1990s. These poems and others appeared on the Themestream website -- this collection consists of that subset that seemed to generate the most commentary.You will find echoes of e.e. cummings and Robert Frost in here; you will find structured poems such as sonnets and others edging more toward the concrete poetry movement. Some deal with feelings, some with impressions, and some combine the two.I've tried to write poetry for everyone, not necessarily for literary types. Perhaps it is unfortunate that poetry is almost exclusively the interest of the literary types today -- how often do people buy books of poetry, save in anthology form?

For security reasons, Fallaci had to move to America, a country she views as the main hope of the Western civilization, and so do I, a citizen of the Czech Republic.During the last years, she became the target of many fanatical Muslims and their fatwas as well as their left-wing allies who have made her life in Italy virtually impossible: her identification with Master Cecco, a victim of the inquisition, is certainly justified. But it was cancer that ultimately killed this extraordinary woman last week.Much like Fallaci, I count myself as a Christian atheist. As most scientists, I appreciate the tough struggles between science and Christianity in which the Church was wrong. Nevertheless, these old disputes seem rather subtle in comparison with the outrageous recent attacks against the main principles underlying the Western civilization, including the power of reason and arguments as opposed to violence and intimidation. Why were the controversies relatively subtle?As the Pope Benedict XVI, who privately met Fallaci a few months before she died, recently explained in Regensburg, the God of Christianity is restricted by His own words and by the laws of logic and mathematics. Allah is not restricted by anything and his followers are not restricted either. They will do anything to spread their beliefs. This fact is magnified by the ambiguous relation between the Quran and violence. Fallaci explains in detail how the Muslim clerics in Europe - a part of the future Eurabia - teach their believers that they shouldn\\'t be restricted by the local laws.Fallaci writes that the threat that the whole Western civilization faces is amplified by the political correctness and by multicultural utopists many of whom have openly become the fifth column of jihad. I have just read a shameful anti-papal (and anti-Fallaci) article in the Guardian and it looks really scary where we seem to be going.As Fallaci convincingly argues, the presence of Islam in the West is directly proportional to our loss of freedom. Her personal experience is captivating but it is not really new to me because I have been exposed to remotely comparable kind of pressure. Everyone who advocates a principle that is inconvenient for various groups of people that are presented as \"suppressed groups\" and especially for their inferior ideologies - even though these ideologies are really starting to control our lives - is immediately hated by a certain segment of the society and labelled as a racist. I know these things extremely well and it was refreshing to read stories from someone with a similar attitude.This new book as well as Fallaci\\'s example should wake up millions of people and make them realize that if they won\\'t actively try to defend the Western values against the pressure of an Asian religion and against the cancer of political correctness, the civilization as we know it could face a genuine risk of destruction.', \"I've read reviews of this book complaining it wasn't well-written, was just lists, went on endlessly for the few half the book.

Clavell has taken the wonderful foundation of Tai-Pan and Shogun and added new levels of depth and complexity.At the beginning of the novel, young Ian Dunross assumes the mantle of Tai-Pan of the Noble House of Struan during a dark and stormy night and a dark and stormy period for the Noble House. The company's holdings are stretched to the limit, and that very night it loses a shipment of valuable contraband at sea. Dunross, heir to the title of Tai-Pan, or supreme leader, is also the kindred spirit to the company's founder, Dirk Struan, the legendary pirate, smuggler, and founder of the Noble House and Hong Kong. Dunross has also inherited the enduring hatred of the family's historical enemies, the Brocks, now personified in Quillan Gornt, head of the Second House. Gornt, a worthy adversary, has his own designs to topple Struan's and take over as the Noble House.But so does everybody else in the novel, it seems, unless the characters are interested in international espionage involving the Soviet Union, Communist China, the United States, or good old England. Triple agents, royalty, thieves, kidnappers, murderers, gangsters, and businessmen rub shoulders in this tempest in the teapot of Hong Kong.The key variables in this play are two Americans on a business trip, who hold the key to finiancial success in Hong Kong. Linc Bartlett is CEO, and his right-hand man is the beautiful woman, K.C. Tcholok. The Americans' ignorance of Hong Kong customs reflects the reader's, and injects a considerable amount of humor into the novel.But, as with Clavell's first novel (Tai-Pan), the center of attention remains the tai-pan. Ian Dunross is the personification of what is good in the British Empire, even though he is as ruthless as they come. He guides the Noble House through a minefield without a map, using his business acumen, guts, and joss to see him through. A climactic ending to an epic story of love, business, and war is immensely satisfying, and leaves you begging for more (just like Tai-Pan, Shogun, and King Rat did before). A must-read!\", 'In my opinion, this was a well written book and contained the best action scenes in a Cussler book so far. I was upset, however, with the simplicity of the plot.

An up and coming actor and a dancer struggle through their problems of career and commitment and the birth of a child.', \"&quot;The Mayor of Casterbridge&quot; feels like something Charles Dickens would have written if he had been a more efficient storyteller, more economical in his prose, and had a better understanding of how humor is supposed to be applied to tragedy, if at all -- with subtlety and congruity. This is not intended to be a slight against Dickens, but rather a testament to the quality of Thomas Hardy's writing.The first chapter alone is a dramatic masterpiece and perfectly sets the rhythm for the rest of the novel. A young man named Michael Henchard and his wife Susan and baby daughter Elizabeth-Jane enter a village where Henchard hopes to find work as a hay-trusser. They go to a country fair where Henchard immediately gets drunk and sells his wife and baby to a sailor. Regretting his actions the next day, Henchard looks for them in vain, swears off liquor for twenty-one years, then takes up residence in a town called Casterbridge.Nineteen years later, Susan, now widowed, and Elizabeth-Jane track Henchard to Casterbridge. It turns out that in the intervening years, Henchard has become a successful granary owner and is now the town's mayor. He welcomes his former wife and daughter, proving himself to be genial but often petty and easily vexed. For one thing, he is in a bitter rivalry with a former employee, a young Scotchman named Donald Farfrae, not only in business but also for the affections of a vixenish woman named Lucetta who has recently moved to town.Hardy wastes no pages unfolding the plot, which is filled with Dickensian intrigue. It chronicles Henchard's relationship with Susan and Elizabeth-Jane after their return, his jealousy over Farfrae and Lucetta (who happens to be Henchard's old flame and inadvertently incites a public scandal because of this), his fear of the discovery of his deceit, and, finally, his feelings of isolation from Elizabeth-Jane and the town he loves. By the end, you realize that Henchard is not a bad man; he's a lonely man who's made the mistake of letting his love for Elizabeth-Jane distort his judgment.Especially impressive is Hardy's prose, which is strong and descriptive without being florid. He has a sharp ear for native dialects, and the dialogue of Casterbridge's inhabitants comes off as genuinely homey chatter rather than just dispensations of information set up to advance the plot. Moreover, like any good fictional place, Casterbridge takes on a vibrant life of its own, offering a realistic bucolic backdrop for this stormy human drama.\", \"This book was just wonderful. From the first moment I opened the cover, there was action, and a story line that would grab anyone. This book follows the adventures of Will and his master, the Ranger Halt. Will had always wanted to be a Knight, yet when he was not allowed to become an apprentice warrior, the mysterious Ranger Halt takes him as his apprentice. Will must learn all the Ranger's skills soon, as a dark and difficult task is ahead.This book has all the elements you need in a children's fantasy book for the ages of 9 - 15 years. I really enjoyed it and can't wait to read the next one.\", \"I picked up this book at a yard sale for fifty cents, and that is about what it was worth. I read NOTHING NEW here that wasn't good old common sense. It seems to me that Ms.Snow is going down Sylvia Browns road and recycling other peoples work.\", 'As a teacher I believe this is a great value for the money.']\n",

      "[\"Like many reviewers, I found this final edition of the Hannibal trilogy somewhat disappointing. What has always made the Lecter character so fascinating has been Harris' unique presentation of an intellectual genius gone totally off the deep end. He's evil, he's nuts, but in an all so mesmerizing way. Now comes 'Hannibal', and we're asked to accept a kinder, gentler madman. But it's actually worse than that. Lecter goes through a transformation so complete that, by the last 50 pages, he becomes a sympathetic, nurturing, father figure. Oh, the horror!! Meanwhile, Starling goes through her own transformation, from clear-eyed, FBI-Semper Fi, do or die trooper to ... Madonna (both of them).Harris does throw us a bone (so to speak) by introducing Mason Verger, a former patient of Lecter's to whom the good doctor performed a face-lift with the minor error of forgetting to re-attach the face. Verger's money and power put him in a position to get revenge on Dr. L. but, truth be told, it's his ghoulish features and the conditions under which he exists that make his character interesting.But back to the Doctor. When last seen, he was riding off in the Buenos Aires sunset with the maiden Starling on his arm. Sorry, but that's not how I want to remember him. Give me the doctor that spoke about eating someone's liver with favre beans and a nice Chianti.\", 'Although I knew it was a used item, the cover wrap was gone and the green hard cover was quite stressed. Otherwise the book was intact and I am happy with it.', 'I really enjoyed this novel. I think for a first book by a teenager it is truly outstanding. The novel is an easy read and I had no problems keeping up with everything. Just an FYI; the book rights have already been bought and the movie expected out in 2005.', 'This book was very cool. You made pomes funny. This boy had a dog that was yellow and that blue car hit him. Wonder if Dr.Hanable Lecter was in it. Hope the dog never felt it. It was cool when the boy made the dog into a poem. The dog disappeared out of the boys life in just a secend. Poor dog he was just ran over by a non stopping car. So Love What Dog?', \"I read this book when it was first published in 1979. I would've given it four stars then, but now this book is hopelessly out-of-date, which most reviewers fail to point out. The &quot;revised&quot; editon of 1997 only added an updated resource guide. Well, the entire book needs updating! I hope Ms. Adler will do so in the near future. So much has happened and changed in the last 25 years of modern paganism. This is still I very good book, but do keep in mind that it is now hardly a comprehensive overview of what Paganism is about in the year 2003. 1979, yes; but now?\", \"That's what &quot;That Quail, Robert&quot; amply demonstrates. Although ornithologists apparently eschew the assignment of human thought and emotion to animals and birds, this book convincingly shows that quails are capable of love and having hurt feelings, and are in need of companionship, just like humans. Quails are also intelligent enough to play games and critique the slightest change in home decor! Of course Robert the Quail was very lucky to have &quot;parents&quot; as loving and doting as the Kienzles and benefited from the fact that they were a retired couple who enjoyed rearing a new &quot;child&quot; after their other children had long since...flown the coop.\", 'Great book for women or anyone who loves to gossip! Also contains great words and gives you a good idea of marriage and romance customs in the past.', \"Dear All,As is always helpful I have read the book a couple of times now. I have also read the highly mixed reviews varying from coffee-shop boredom and a philosophy teachers irritation to some people who have genuinely loved this book. I must say that I can sympathise in part with both views. Indeed, if you have already formed some views on philosophy (and you may not be aware that you have) then be prepared, for you may be in for a few irritating moments. However, as is demonstrated by so many who have read and reviewed this book it has been a source of immense enjoyment and for many it seems to have changed their lives for the better. I am not going to bore anyone with the rigours of whether his philosophy is consistent or not but I will say that I am glad that he offers some healthy scepticism to many of todays accepted views.If you want philosophy, do read the book but remember that many of the views are contentious. In other words read with your eyes open and make your own minds up. As some of the less than happy readers have pointed out, there are many good books on philosophy so don't forget about those.As for whether you will be bored or not I think that it is quite clear from the reviews, varying from 5 star to 1 star, that you will just have to read it to find out. I hope you do not find the experience to be a waste.\", 'I am reviewing the audio version and I have to say, if you listen to the JD Robb \"In Death\" series, this will be confusing. This is a retread of the voices used there: Dallas, Feeney, Mavis, Cher Rio - the gang\\'s all there. Except Roark, but I\\'m not finished yet, so you never know....', \"that would be the ideal way to describe Dorian Gray - an impressionable young Adonis on his Hedonistic quest for a life which itself is a work of art. Society artist Basil Hallward's portrait of Dorian Gray which ages and hardens as Gray's quest lead him to a remorseless and brutal lifestyle is the mirror to his soul while his physical form remains as youthful as ever. The book builds up beautifully towards the climax. Wilde's generates idle irreverent amoral and bitingly sarcastic dialogue as if out of thin air.\", 'the mafia in LA was a joke before fiato came along he and his crew were more violent than any mobsters LA has ever seen.anybody who throws somone down a flight of stairs and give them a beating in Beverly Hills Fiars Club and gets away with it speaks volums of how much he was feared before Fiato the mob there was called the Mickey Mouse Mafia.', 'I had a good time reading through this reprint of Morris Morgan\\'s 1893 translation of Xenophon\\'s \"The Art of Horsemanship\" (350 BC). Unlike many of the other ancient Greek translations and authors, this one is very easy to read.The text itself is fairly short and reads quickly, sprinkled with wisdom. After the text is another short portion from 1893, which talks about \"The Greek Riding-Horse\", based on Xenophon and all the other available sources. Additionally, the footnotes to the text are quite interesting--I read them, for the most part, en block after reading the text.As the title implies, the text is a very hands-on, practical guide to \"everything you need to know\" about how to take care of and look good riding a horse, reading like a \"Horsemanship for Dummies\" book. If you\\'re interested in Ancient Greece and horses, you\\'ve got to read this short \"instruction manual\", though if you\\'re only interested in the ancients, it\\'s still fun to breeze through this text, nevertheless.', 'This is a great gift for the life sciences researcher on your list. Great annotations, phoographs, additional material. Beautifully presented, as well.', \"Jane Eyre is a Classic of epic proportions, it is a story which is timeless. From her early home life at Gateshead to her schooling at Lowood School then her stint as the Governess at Thornfield Manor the author breaks your heart, makes you feel such compassion and leads you down a journey of life's trials and tribulation.Her want of love and acceptance is a theme that plays out throughout the book.It is a timeless story with themes that center around Morals, Religion, Social Class and relationships between men and women.Charlotte Bronte gives us a beautiful story.\", \"Carmen,Jewell and Regina became friends after meeting in college. What a beautiful friendship that grew into the three women ending up like sisters. Real friends get mad at each other but grow from it like these women did. I think that I am all three of these women rolled up in one being the most like Carmen.I totally understood why when every thing in Carmen's life was going good she was waiting for lighting to strike. I have always been like that until recently when I realized that Life is just Life very complex. This was a nice enlightening read.WARNING: There are some spoilers in the other reviews that will take away from the book.\", 'i enjoyed this download also and the item was exactly as advertised... i will be downloading more stuff to read in the future.', 'I picked it up because of an article about it being banned for high school. The reasons it was being considered banned, adult content, I have not really found to be the case, but I do not think it is a good book for a high school student. Mainly it is very slow and boring. The main characters life is boring and the author does a good job bringing that across in the book. When you have nothing to do for most of the day you tend to day dream or fall back on old memories and that is what a great majority of the book does. It makes for an interesting read if you can get past the slowness and the constant flash back to a better time.', 'I was fortunate enough to listen to the audio tape read by Ron Silver, whose voice is so melodic and mesmerizing, it led me on and on to the finish of this unique, loveable novel. It\\'s an autobiographical fiction: true on both counts. I believe Roth is a genius. I\\'ve read or seen the films of just about everything he\\'s written. He makes me feel warm by addressing ideas that really matter and by bringing family stories alive. Little Philip is a noble, caring child, whose values stem from parents with commendable values. They take risks ; never flinch from helping others in perilous or pitiable situations. Of course, we also hear the other side of Philip\\'s thinking; sometimes he is disgusted by the people he knows he must help, but this doesn\\'t stop him. I loved the way he puzzled over enigmas: people and situations he didn\\'t - couldn\\'t - possibly understand. And this book shows us how wild his imagination was right from the start. He was born to be a writer; to tell stories. His sentences: marvels of construction. I love following them to their exhilerating conclusions. Bravo, Mr. Roth. You did it again! I hope you\\'re working on another marvelous book. I\\'m just about to start reading \"The Human Stain\" - I can hardly wait!', \"And I don't say that lightly. It really is the WORST book ever. My favorite book of all time is The Vampire Lestat, so it hurts to have to say that. But it is true. From the first diatribe ridden page to the last anti climatic ludicrus page it is truly horrible. I've read and reread all of Rice's books except for Feast of All Saints and I've liked all of them (except Taltos and to some extent Memnoch the Devil; but at least that book had SOME redeeming qualities, Blood Canticle has NONE). I refuse to even think that the character in this book is actually Lestat. There is almost no similiarity to the Lestat I know very well and love. This is a completely different character who is boring, juvenile, and insipid. None of the characters are consistent with what they were in the previous books. Michael is reduced to just having a hot bod and being Rowan's cast off. Mona is a brainless you know what. Rowan is a shadow of her former self. The love story between Lestat and Rowan is unbelieveable, laughable, ridiculous and painful to have to read. The storyline about the Taltos is almost disgusting and it is beyond that, besides any point I could see the novel might have. I could say so many things about this book. When I heard about the plot about Lestat wanting to be a Saint, I thought it would be very interesting. It is so far from interesting it goes absolutely nowhere. He yammers on and on about some obscure saint, and has nothing insightful to say about the subject. Inexplicably he gives up the subject half way through and goes of to have a relationship with Rowan who he is paired with through some sort of convenience for the author to try to wrap things up. Lestat could have gone out gracefully, but this book cuts his head off and buries him in sludge (not literally of course). I was excited for Julien to be in the book.....he is hardly in it and is ineffectual as a ghost, person, or character. I see no reason for him being in the book at all. I could go on and on. Seriously, and no kidding, worst book ever.\", 'I think this is the novel where Chandler started to take his press clippings seriously and tried to write an Important Book. While it\\'s a very good book, the book feels like a lesser sequel to his previous four classic novels perhaps because it strays a little more from its pulp roots. In the earlier books, he showed us the seamy side of Los Angeles, and the characters demonstrated their basic corruption through their actions. There is some of that in this novel as well, but he also feels the need to tell us what Philip Marlowe actually thinks about your average person. \"Tired men in dusty coupes and sedans winced and tightened their grip on the wheel and ploughed on north and west toward home and dinner, the whining of their spoiled children and the gabble of their silly wives.\" True, probably. Pleasant, no. Marlowe also occasionally indulges in self pity. A flawed hero is one thing; an unlikable one is something else altogether.There\\'s no leavening the unpleasantness as even Marlowe himself doesn\\'t come off well. As misanthropic as Marlowe becomes in this novel, you wonder why he even bothers to do his Don Quixote thing. In this book, I think Chandler strays somewhat from his original concept of Marlowe, and the book suffers as a result. Still a good read, but far from classic.']\n"

      "[\"As a student of international business and economics, I have been required to read a variety of business and investing texts. However, I have yet to read anything, be it a textbook or a practical business book, that covers the scope of Peter Marber's From Third World To World Class. Marber's thorough grasp of history and professional experience makes for a comprehensive, insightful and truly enjoyable read that is informative and highly original. As compared to other books that discuss Emerging Markets, such as the very general biography of emerging markets investing by Mark Mobius or the predictions of Jeffrey Garten's The Big Ten, Marber's work combines theory and practice, producing a book that tackles today's most controversial business issues with a refreshingly optimistic perspective. But perhaps what is most impressive about Marber's work is that he establishes a clear path for the reader to follow. Unlike other authors, Marber gives you a well-researched past! , present and future, by telling the story of Emerging Markets investing through history and, when relevant, injecting anecdotes and hard facts. Marber's book is powerful both for its content and presentation. By taking an academics' approach to story telling and using a successful investors voice to share his theories, Marber presents a compelling work from which one can truly learn about the financial and political implications of the changing global economy, and how we can all benefit.\"]\n"

New techniques have been added and the old material have been rewritten in a more educational way.This combination makes this book a perfect choise for a good start for beginners and a beauty to study for non.', \"This is a terrific book.
